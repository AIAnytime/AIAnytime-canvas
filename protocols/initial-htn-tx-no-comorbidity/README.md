# Initial Treatment of Hypertension

This protocol outlines the initial treatment steps for hypertension, emphasizing lifestyle interventions and a stepwise approach to medication therapy. The choice of medication is based on blood pressure levels, albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), and response to initial treatments.

## Summary of the Protocol

1. **Lifestyle Interventions:**
   - All motivated hypertensive patients should receive counseling about lifestyle interventions to lower blood pressure (BP).

2. **Assess Blood Pressure:**
   - **Is the systolic pressure >20 mmHg above the goal and/or is the diastolic pressure >10 mmHg above the goal?**
     - **Yes:** Initiate an ACE inhibitor (or ARB) plus a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker
     - **No:** Assess Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR)

3. **Assess ACR:**
   - **ACR â‰¥300 mg/g?**
     - **Yes:** Initiate an ACE inhibitor (or ARB)
     - **No:** Initiate an ACE inhibitor (or ARB) or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker

4. **Treatment Steps:**
   - **BP remains uncontrolled:**
     - Combine an ACE inhibitor (or ARB) and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker
     - **BP remains uncontrolled:** Add a thiazide-like diuretic
     - **BP remains uncontrolled:** Apparent resistant hypertension

## Protocol Caveats

- **Lifestyle Interventions:**
  - Lifestyle changes are crucial and should be the first step in managing hypertension.

- **Blood Pressure and ACR:**
  - Initial medication choices depend on how much the BP exceeds the goal and the patient's ACR levels.

- **Stepwise Medication Approach:**
  - The protocol follows a stepwise approach to add or change medications based on the patient's BP response to initial treatments.
