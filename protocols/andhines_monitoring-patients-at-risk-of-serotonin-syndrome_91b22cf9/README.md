# Summary of Clinical Protocol for Monitoring Patients at Risk of Serotonin Syndrome

The primary goal of this clinical protocol is to effectively monitor and manage patients who are at risk of developing serotonin syndrome due to their medication regimens. The protocol aims to identify at-risk patients, conduct thorough screenings, and implement interventions to prevent the onset of serotonin syndrome.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients currently prescribed medications that increase serotonin levels, such as SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and other serotonergic agents. From this group, a subset is selected for screening based on the concurrent prescription of additional medications that may interact to elevate the risk of serotonin syndrome. These interacting medications include other serotonergic drugs, certain opioids like tramadol and fentanyl, triptans, linezolid, and St. John's Wort.

Patients are excluded from the screening subset if they have a documented history of serotonin syndrome and are no longer on interacting medications, have discontinued all serotonergic medications for at least five half-lives, or are under palliative care where the benefits of symptom management outweigh the risks.

For those in the screening subset, the protocol recommends several diagnostic interventions. These include a comprehensive medication review to identify potential drug interactions, a clinical assessment for symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, dilated pupils, muscle rigidity, and hyperreflexia, and laboratory tests to rule out other causes of symptoms.

A screen is deemed successful if potential drug interactions are identified and addressed through medication adjustment or discontinuation. Additionally, patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop. Follow-up appointments are also scheduled to reassess the patient's condition and medication regimen.
