# Screening for Obesity in Children and Adolescents

## Purpose of the protocol
To update the 2010 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for obesity in children 6 years and older.

## Target population
- if age >= 6 years and age <= 19 years
- if BMI >= 95th percentile based on age- and sex-specific CDC growth charts

## Recommendation
The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years and older and offer or refer them to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions to promote improvements in weight status (B recommendation).

## Importance
- Prevalence: Approximately 17% of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years in the United States have obesity.
- Health Risks: Associated with mental health and psychological issues, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, orthopedic problems, and adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes (e.g., high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, and insulin resistance).
- Long-term Impact: Obesity in childhood and adolescence may continue into adulthood, leading to adverse cardiovascular outcomes or other obesity-related morbidity such as type 2 diabetes.
## Conclusion
Comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions (â‰¥26 contact hours) in children and adolescents 6 years and older who have obesity can result in improvements in weight status for up to 12 months. The harms of behavioral interventions are minimal, and the harms of screening are minimal.
