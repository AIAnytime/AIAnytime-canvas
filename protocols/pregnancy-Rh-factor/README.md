### Purpose of the Protocol
The protocol aims to prevent maternal sensitization and improve outcomes for newborns by identifying and managing Rh (D) incompatibility in pregnant women.

### Studied Group 
- **All Pregnant Women**: Initial Rh (D) blood typing and antibody testing during the first visit for pregnancy-related care.
- **Unsensitized Rh (D)-Negative Women**: Repeated Rh (D) antibody testing selected for those at 24–28 weeks’ gestation, unless the biological father is known to be Rh (D)-negative.

### Recommended Actions
- **For all Pregnant Women**: Administer Rh (D) blood typing and antibody testing at the first prenatal visit. Follow up with Rh (D) immunoglobulin intervention as appropriate.
- **For Unsensitized Rh (D)-Negative Women**:
  - Repeat Rh (D) antibody testing at 24–28 weeks’ gestation. 
  - Administer a full dose (300µg) of Rh (D) immunoglobulin after the repeated antibody testing if still unsensitized and at risk.
  - If an Rh (D)-positive or weakly Rh (D)-positive infant is delivered, repeat the dose of Rh (D) immunoglobulin postpartum within 72 hours.
  - After amniocentesis or induced/spontaneous abortion in unsensitized Rh (D)-negative women, administer a full dose of Rh (D) immunoglobulin. For pregnancies less than 13 weeks, a 50 µg dose is sufficient.

### Additional Considerations
The protocol notes that the benefit of routine administration of Rh (D) immunoglobulin following other obstetric procedures (e.g., ectopic pregnancy termination, chordocentesis) remains uncertain due to inadequate evidence. Moreover, it highlights that there's no new evidence regarding screening, new tests, or treatment protocols beyond what is already known about Rh (D) incompatibility management.

This summary elucidates the USPSTF's recommendations on the management of Rh (D) incompatibility in pregnant women, focusing on both initial screening and subsequent interventions based on the mother's Rh status and response to initial screening.
