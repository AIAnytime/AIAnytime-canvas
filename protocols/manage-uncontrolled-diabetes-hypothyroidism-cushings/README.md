### Target Population
Patients who have abnormal laboratory test results related to endocrinological conditions. Individuals with high Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels, abnormal Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels, or elevated 24-hour urine cortisol levels.
### Recommendations
If a patient's A1c is greater than 9, or if their TSH or 24-hour urine cortisol levels are abnormal, they should be referred to their primary care provider (PCP) or a specialist, such as an endocrinologist. 
### Importance
Ensuring that patients with significant endocrine abnormalities receive timely and appropriate follow-up care. By systematically identifying and referring patients with abnormal lab results.
### Conclusion
Automates the process of managing abnormal lab results related to endocrine disorders. It evaluates test results, determines if referrals are necessary, and updates the clinicianâ€™s workflow accordingly.
