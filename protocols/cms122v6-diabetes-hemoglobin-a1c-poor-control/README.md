## Target Population
Designed for patients aged 18-75 who have been diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Targeting inidividuals whose most recent Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level is above 9.0% or who do not have a documented HbA1c test result within the measurement period.

## Recommendations
1. For Patients Without Recent HbA1c Testing: Order an HbA1c test if one has not been performed recently. 

2. For Patients With Elevated HbA1c Levels: Discuss lifestyle modifications and medication compliance.

## Importance
High HbA1c levels (> 9.0%) indicate poor glycemic control, which significantly increases the risk of these complications. By monitoring and managing HbA1c levels effectively, this protocol aims to improve patient outcomes and reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with diabetes.

## Conclusion
Identifying patients with poor glycemic control, helps to ensure timely interventions that can mitigate the risk of severe complications.
