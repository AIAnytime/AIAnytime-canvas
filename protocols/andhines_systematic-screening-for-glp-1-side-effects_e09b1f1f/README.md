# Summary of Systematic Screening for Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to ensure the safety and well-being of patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists by systematically screening for potential side effects and adjusting treatment as necessary.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients receiving care within the healthcare system. From this group, a subset is considered: those prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists such as exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide. The protocol excludes patients who have discontinued GLP-1 medications for over 30 days, have allergies or contraindications, or are part of clinical trials monitoring GLP-1 side effects.

The protocol outlines several key actions:

1. **Diagnostic Actions**: At each patient visit, a systematic screening for side effects associated with GLP-1 medications is conducted. This includes checking for gastrointestinal symptoms, pancreatitis, thyroid tumors, and hypoglycemia using a standardized questionnaire or checklist.

2. **Therapeutic Actions**: If side effects are detected, their severity and impact on the patient's quality of life are evaluated. Adjustments to the GLP-1 medication dosage or a switch to an alternative therapy may be made based on clinical judgment and patient preference.

3. **Administrative Actions**: All findings from the side effect screenings are documented in the patient's electronic health record (EHR). Follow-up appointments are scheduled as needed to monitor the patient's response to any changes in therapy.

4. **Consultation Actions**: If severe or persistent side effects are identified, consultation with a specialist, such as an endocrinologist or gastroenterologist, is recommended. Patients are also educated on recognizing and managing potential side effects of GLP-1 medications.

5. **Review and Update**: The protocol is reviewed annually to incorporate new evidence or changes in clinical guidelines related to GLP-1 medications.

Important information includes:
- The protocol targets patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists within the healthcare system.
- Exclusion criteria are clearly defined to ensure appropriate patient selection.
- A comprehensive approach is taken to identify, document, and manage side effects.
- The protocol emphasizes patient education and specialist consultation for severe cases.
- Regular updates ensure the protocol remains aligned with the latest clinical evidence and guidelines.
