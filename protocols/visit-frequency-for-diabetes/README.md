### Target Population
Patients diagnosed with diabetes, specifically those with varying levels of glucose control. It is particularly suitable for patients who have a history of diabetes and are receiving regular diabetes management and monitoring. Additionally, it considers patients with other conditions that could affect their life expectancy, such as end-stage heart failure, metastatic malignancy, or end-stage renal disease, as well as elderly patients aged 80 and above.
### Recommendations
Schedule follow-up appointments based on the patient's diabetes control level:

- Very Poorly Controlled Diabetes: Appointments should be scheduled every 1 month.
- Poorly Controlled Diabetes: Appointments should be scheduled every 3 months.
- Well-Controlled Diabetes: Appointments should be scheduled every 6 months.

The protocol also advises re-evaluating the patientâ€™s appointment schedule whenever there is a new lab result or appointment update to ensure the timing remains appropriate.
### Importance
Ensuring timely follow-up appointments is crucial for managing diabetes effectively. This protocol helps maintain optimal diabetes control by aligning appointment schedules with the patient's control level, thereby potentially reducing complications and improving overall patient outcomes. By integrating this into the workflow, healthcare providers can systematically monitor and manage diabetes care, leading to better adherence to treatment plans and improved patient health.
### Conclusion
This protocol automates the management of diabetes follow-up appointments by leveraging clinical data such as lab results and appointment history. It provides a structured approach to scheduling based on the patient's current diabetes control level and overall health status. This can significantly streamline clinician workflows by reducing manual tracking and follow-up tasks.
