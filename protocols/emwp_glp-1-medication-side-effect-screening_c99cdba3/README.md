# Summary of the Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically screen for side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists to ensure patient safety and optimize treatment outcomes.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of patients currently on GLP-1 medications, such as liraglutide and semaglutide. It then narrows down to a subset of patients who have been on these medications for at least four weeks and have not had a side effect screening in the past three months. Exclusion criteria are outlined to ensure the focus is on appropriate candidates. Diagnostic interventions are recommended to identify and document any side effects, with a follow-up plan for those affected.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population**: Includes all patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists like liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and albiglutide.

- **Subset for Screening**: 
  - Patients on GLP-1 medications for a minimum of four weeks.
  - Patients without a documented side effect screening in the last three months.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Patients with allergies or contraindications to GLP-1 medications.
  - Patients who have stopped GLP-1 medications within the last four weeks.
  - Patients in clinical trials with existing side effect monitoring.
  - Patients with terminal illness or in palliative care.

- **Diagnostic Interventions**:
  - Comprehensive review of medical history and current symptoms.
  - Standardized questionnaire for common side effects like gastrointestinal issues and signs of pancreatitis.
  - Laboratory tests, such as serum amylase and lipase, if pancreatitis is suspected.

- **Conditions for Successful Screens**:
  - Documenting new or worsening side effects since starting GLP-1 therapy.
  - Communicating findings to patients, including education on side effects and when to seek help.
  - Recommending healthcare provider consultations for significant side effects or medication adjustments.
  - Establishing follow-up plans for patients with identified side effects, including scheduling further screenings or consultations.

This protocol ensures a structured approach to monitoring side effects, enhancing patient care and safety for those on GLP-1 medications.
