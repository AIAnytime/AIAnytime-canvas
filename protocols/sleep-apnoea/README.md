### Target Population
This protocol is designed for patients diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Hypopnoea Syndrome (OSAHS), identified using ICD10CM code G4733 and SNOMED CT code 101301000119106.
### Recommendations
The protocol assesses whether a patient with OSAHS should be offered Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. It checks if the patient has been previously advised to use CPAP. If not, it triggers a recommendation to offer CPAP treatment, which can be actioned directly from the system.
### Importance
OSAHS is a serious condition that can lead to significant health complications if untreated. Offering CPAP can improve patient outcomes by effectively managing this condition. This protocol ensures that patients who need CPAP are identified and appropriately advised, aligning with clinical guidelines and best practices for managing sleep apnea.
### Conclusion
By implementing this protocol, clinicians can streamline the process of recommending CPAP for OSAHS patients. It automates the identification of patients who have not yet received this recommendation, reducing manual follow-ups and ensuring timely interventions. This integration can enhance clinical workflow efficiency, support adherence to treatment guidelines, and improve patient care outcomes.
