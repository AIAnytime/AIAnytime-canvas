# Summary of the Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically screen for side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, ensuring patient safety and effective management of potential adverse effects.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of patients currently on GLP-1 medications, such as liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide. It then narrows down to a subset of patients who have been on these medications for at least four weeks and have not undergone side effect screening in the past three months. Exclusion criteria are outlined to ensure the focus remains on patients who can benefit most from the screening. The protocol recommends a series of diagnostic interventions, including medical history reviews, laboratory tests, and patient-reported outcome measures. The goal is to identify any new or worsening side effects, communicate findings to patients, and establish follow-up plans if necessary.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population**: All patients currently prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists.
- **Subset for Screening**:
  - Patients on GLP-1 medications for a minimum of 4 weeks.
  - Patients without a documented side effect screening in the past 3 months.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Known allergy or hypersensitivity to GLP-1 medications.
  - Discontinuation of GLP-1 medications within the last 4 weeks.
  - Participation in a clinical trial with regular side effect monitoring.
  - Terminal illness or palliative care focus.

- **Diagnostic Interventions**:
  - Comprehensive review of medical history and current symptoms.
  - Laboratory tests: renal function, liver function, and pancreatic enzyme levels.
  - Patient-reported outcome measures for side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

- **Conditions for Successful Screens**:
  - Identification and documentation of new or worsening side effects.
  - Clear communication of findings and education on side effects to patients.
  - Recommendation for healthcare provider consultation if significant side effects are identified.
  - Establishment of a follow-up plan, including potential medication adjustment or discontinuation.
