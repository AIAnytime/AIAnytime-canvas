# Hormone Therapy for Postmenopausal: Final Recommendation
## Purpose of the protocol
To provide updated recommendations on the use of hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal individuals.

## Target population
- Asymptomatic postmenopausal individuals considering hormone therapy for chronic condition prevention.
- Excludes those considering hormone therapy for perimenopausal symptoms such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness.
- Excludes those who have had premature menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency) or surgical menopause.
## Recommendation
- Do not use combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons.
- Do not use estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons who have had a hysterectomy.
## Importance
- Natural menopause occurs at a median age of 51.3 years.
- Chronic disease prevalence and incidence (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis) increase with age.
- Average life expectancy post-menopause exceeds 30 years.
- Uncertainty exists regarding chronic conditions' risks attributable solely to menopause.
## Conclusion
The recommendations advise against the use of hormone therapy (combined estrogen and progestin or estrogen alone) for preventing chronic conditions in postmenopausal individuals due to the lack of net benefit, emphasizing a tailored approach for menopause symptom management only.
