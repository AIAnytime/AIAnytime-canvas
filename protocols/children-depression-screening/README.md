The document is a final recommendation statement by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on screening for depression and suicide risk in children and adolescents. Below is a summary of the protocol:

### Purpose of the Protocol:
The protocol aims to update the 2014 and 2016 USPSTF recommendations regarding the screening for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and suicide risk in children and adolescents, focusing on the benefits, harms, and accuracy of such screenings in primary care settings.

### Studied Group:
- **Adolescents aged 12 to 18 years** who do not have a diagnosed mental health condition or show recognized signs or symptoms of depression or suicide risk.
- **Children 11 years or younger** fall under a separate consideration due to insufficient evidence on the benefits of screening in this age group.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **For Adolescents (12 to 18 Years)**: 
   - **Screening for MDD is recommended** (B recommendation). This is based on moderate certainty that such screening has a moderate net benefit concerning identifying depression and potentially improving outcomes through early treatment.
   - **Evidence is insufficient** to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk due to a lack of evidence.

2. **For Children (11 Years or Younger)**:
   - **Current evidence is insufficient** to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for MDD (I statement).
   - Similar to adolescents, **insufficient evidence** also applies to screening for suicide risk in this group.

### Summary of Evidence:
- **For Adolescents**: Adequate evidence exists that screening tools are accurate for identifying MDD, and treatment of detected MDD can result in moderate benefits (e.g., improved depression symptoms). Limitations include inadequate evidence regarding the benefits of screening for younger children and the harms related to both screening and intervention across age groups.
- **For MDD and Suicide Risk**: The lack of sufficient evidence for children 11 years or younger and for suicide risk screening across all child and adolescent ages remains a concern, highlighting the need for more research in these areas.

### Practice Considerations:
- The recommendations apply specifically to those without a current mental health diagnosis and without apparent symptoms of MDD or suicide risk.
- The focus is on MDD and does not extend to other depressive disorders like minor depression or dysthymia.

In conclusion, this protocol underscores the USPSTF's position on the importance of screening adolescents aged 12 to 18 years for MDD while acknowledging the need for more evidence regarding younger children and for suicide risk screening in general.
