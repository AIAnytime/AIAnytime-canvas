### Target Population
This protocol is designed for patients with diabetes who may also have hypertension or albuminuria and uses the following criteria:

**Diabetes Diagnosis:** The patient must have an active diagnosis of diabetes. 
- This is checked by the has_diabetes() method, which returns True if the patient has an active condition found in the Diabetes value set.

**Albuminuria or Hypertension:** The patient should either have albuminuria or hypertension.
- Albuminuria is checked by the has_albuminuria() method, which looks for active conditions in the Proteinuria value set or evaluates the albumin/creatinine ratio to see if it's 30 or above.
- Hypertension is checked by the has_hypertension() method, which returns True if the patient has an active condition found in the DiagnosisOfHypertension value set.

**Blood Pressure Readings:** If the patient does not have albuminuria or hypertension, the protocol then checks the patient's blood pressure readings.
- The patient is included if any blood pressure reading has a systolic value greater than 130 or a diastolic value greater than 80

### Recommendations

#### For Patients with Albuminuria:

- **No ACEI/ARB Prescription**: If the patient has albuminuria but is not on an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), the protocol recommends considering an ACEI or ARB and provides **Lisinopril** (an ACEI) and a suggestion.

- **Not on Maximum Tolerated Dose**: If the patient is on an ACEI or ARB but not at the maximum tolerated dose, the protocol recommends uptitrating (increasing the dose) to the maximum tolerated level to provide renal protection.

#### For Patients Without Albuminuria:

- **Not on ACEI/ARB**: If the patient does not have albuminuria and is not on an ACEI or ARB, the protocol recommends starting **Lisinopril** (an ACEI).

- **Not on Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB)**: If the patient is not on a calcium channel blocker, the protocol recommends prescribing **Amlodipine** (a CCB).

- **Not on Thiazide Diuretic**: If the patient is not on a thiazide diuretic, the protocol recommends prescribing **Hydrochlorothiazide** (a thiazide diuretic).

### Importance
Proper management of blood pressure in diabetic patients is critical to prevent further complications such as cardiovascular disease and kidney damage. This protocol ensures that patients receive appropriate antihypertensive treatment based on their specific conditions and lab results, thereby improving overall patient care and adherence to clinical guidelines.

### Conclusion
By implementing this protocol, clinicians can streamline the process of prescribing and adjusting antihypertensive medications for diabetic patients. It automates the evaluation of patient conditions, lab results, and medication statuses to provide tailored recommendations. This approach enhances the efficiency of clinical workflows and supports better patient outcomes by ensuring adherence to evidence-based guidelines.
