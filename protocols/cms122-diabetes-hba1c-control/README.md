### Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Poor Control (>9%)

**Measure Identifier**: CMS122v10

**Developed by**: National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)

**Description**:
This measure evaluates the percentage of patients aged 18-75 years with diabetes who had a hemoglobin A1c greater than 9.0% during the measurement period. A higher percentage indicates poor diabetes control, which is associated with significant health risks.

#### Measurement Period
- **January 1, 20XX to December 31, 20XX**

#### Rationale
Diabetes remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting approximately 34 million Americans as of 2017. Proper management of hemoglobin A1c levels can mitigate risks of microvascular complications, such as kidney, eye, and nerve diseases.

#### Clinical Recommendations
- **Goals**: 
  - For most nonpregnant adults, an A1c goal of <7% is recommended.
  - Less stringent goals (<8%) may be appropriate for patients with significant comorbidities or complications.
  
#### Measure Scoring
- **Type**: Intermediate Clinical Outcome
- **Improvement Notation**: Lower scores indicate better quality.

#### Inclusions
- Patients 18-75 years old with diabetes and at least one medical visit during the measurement year.

#### Exclusions
- Patients in hospice care or those with a diagnosis of secondary diabetes due to another condition.

#### Data Elements
- **Numerator**: Patients with most recent HbA1c >9% or not measured during the measurement period.
- **Denominator**: All patients meeting the initial population criteria minus exclusions.

This clinical measure aims to highlight the importance of monitoring and managing high A1c levels to prevent serious diabetes-related complications.
