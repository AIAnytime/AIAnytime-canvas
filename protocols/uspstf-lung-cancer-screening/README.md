# Lung Cancer Screening Protocol

## Start

The protocol begins with determining whether an individual should be recommended for screening based on specific criteria.

## Age 50-80?

1. **Question**: Is the individual between the ages of 50 and 80?
    - **Yes**: Proceed to the next criterion.
    - **No**: Do not recommend screening.

## 20 Pack-Year Smoking History?

2. **Question**: Does the individual have a 20 pack-year smoking history?
    - **Yes**: Proceed to the next criterion.
    - **No**: Do not recommend screening.

## Currently Smokes or Quit < 15 Years Ago?

3. **Question**: Does the individual currently smoke or did they quit less than 15 years ago?
    - **Yes**: Recommend screening.
    - **No**: Do not recommend screening.

## Summary

- If the individual is between 50 and 80 years old, has a 20 pack-year smoking history, and currently smokes or quit less than 15 years ago, **recommend screening**.
- If any of the above criteria are not met, **do not recommend screening**.

This protocol ensures that screenings are recommended for individuals at higher risk based on age, smoking history, and recency of smoking.
