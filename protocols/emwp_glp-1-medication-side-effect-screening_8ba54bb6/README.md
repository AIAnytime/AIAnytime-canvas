# Summary of the Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically identify and manage side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, ensuring patient safety and effective medication use.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of patients currently on GLP-1 medications, such as liraglutide and semaglutide. It then narrows down to a subset of patients who have been on these medications for at least four weeks and have not had a side effect screening in the past three months. Exclusion criteria include patients with known allergies to GLP-1 medications, those who have discontinued use for over four weeks, and those hospitalized for unrelated acute conditions. The protocol recommends a comprehensive review of medical history, a standardized questionnaire for common side effects, and necessary lab tests. Successful screenings involve documenting side effects, educating patients, and ensuring follow-up care, with all findings recorded in the patient's electronic health record.

## Important Information:

- **Initial Population**: Includes all patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists like liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and albiglutide.

- **Subset for Screening**: Focuses on patients who have been on GLP-1 medications for at least four weeks and lack a recent side effect screening.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Patients with known allergies or hypersensitivity to GLP-1 medications.
  - Patients who have stopped GLP-1 medications for more than four weeks.
  - Patients hospitalized for acute conditions unrelated to GLP-1 side effects.

- **Diagnostic Interventions**:
  - Comprehensive review of medical history and current symptoms.
  - Standardized questionnaire for side effects like gastrointestinal issues, pancreatitis, thyroid tumors, and hypoglycemia.
  - Lab tests such as serum amylase and lipase for pancreatitis or thyroid function tests if indicated.

- **Conditions for Successful Screens**:
  - Documenting any side effects experienced by the patient.
  - Communicating findings and educating patients on side effects and management.
  - Recommending follow-up consultations if significant side effects are identified.
  - Recording the screening process and outcomes in the patient's electronic health record for continuity of care.
