    ScreeningSubset [label="Subset Considered for Screening" shape=box style=rounded color=green fontcolor=green comment="Patients from the initial population who have been on GLP-1 medications for a minimum duration of 4 weeks, as side effects may not be immediately apparent. Patients who have not had a documented side effect screening in the past 3 months."];
    ExclusionCriteria [label="Exclusion Criteria" shape=box style=rounded color=green fontcolor=green comment="Patients with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to GLP-1 medications, as they should not be on these medications. Patients who have discontinued GLP-1 medications for more than 4 weeks prior to the screening. Patients currently hospitalized for acute conditions unrelated to GLP-1 medication side effects, as their primary care needs may take precedence."];
    DiagnosticInterventions [label="Diagnostic Interventions" shape=box style=rounded color=green fontcolor=green comment="Conduct a comprehensive review of the patient's medical history and current symptoms. Administer a standardized questionnaire to assess common side effects associated with GLP-1 medications, including but not limited to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), pancreatitis, thyroid tumors, and hypoglycemia. Perform necessary laboratory tests if indicated by the questionnaire responses, such as serum amylase and lipase levels for pancreatitis suspicion or thyroid function tests if thyroid-related symptoms are reported."];
    SuccessfulScreens [label="Conditions for Successful Screens" shape=box style=rounded color=green fontcolor=green comment="Identification and documentation of any side effects experienced by the patient. Clear communication of findings to the patient, including education on potential side effects and their management. Recommendation for a follow-up consultation with a healthcare provider if significant side effects are identified or if the patient expresses concerns about their medication. Documentation of the screening process and outcomes in the patient's electronic health record for future reference and continuity of care."];
