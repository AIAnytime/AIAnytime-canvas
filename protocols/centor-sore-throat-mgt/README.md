# Clinical Protocol for Sore Throat Management

## Patient with Sore Throat

The clinical protocol for managing a patient with a sore throat involves evaluating them using the Modified Centor Criteria.

## Modified Centor Criteria

The criteria include:
1. Absence of Cough
2. Swollen and Tender Anterior Cervical Nodes
3. Temperature >38°C (100.4°F)
4. Tonsillar Exudates or Swelling
5. Age:
   - 3-14 years (+1)
   - 15-44 years (0)
   - ≥45 years (-1)

Based on the number of criteria met, a score is assigned.

## Score 0-1: Low Risk

- **Management**: No Testing, No Antibiotics

## Score 2-3: Moderate Risk

- **Management**: Perform RADT (Rapid Antigen Detection Test) or Throat Culture
    - **Negative Test**: No Antibiotics
    - **Positive Test**: Antibiotics

## Score 4-5: High Risk

- **Management**: Consider Empiric Antibiotic Treatment

## Summary

- **Low Risk (Score 0-1)**: No testing or antibiotics required.
- **Moderate Risk (Score 2-3)**: Perform RADT or throat culture, and prescribe antibiotics only if the test is positive.
- **High Risk (Score 4-5)**: Consider starting empirical antibiotic treatment.

This protocol helps ensure appropriate management of sore throat based on the patient's risk level determined by the Modified Centor Criteria.
