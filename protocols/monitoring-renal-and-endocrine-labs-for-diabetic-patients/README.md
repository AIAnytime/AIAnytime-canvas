### Target Population
Diabetic patients who need regular monitoring of specific laboratory tests to manage their condition effectively.
### Recommendations
Laboratory tests within the past year, including:

- Albumin/Creatine Ratio Test
- LDL Cholesterol Test
- Potassium Test
If a patient has missed any of these tests, the protocol will identify the gaps and suggest necessary follow-ups.
### Importance
Regular monitoring of these tests is crucial for managing diabetes and preventing complications. By ensuring that patients undergo these tests, healthcare providers can better manage the patientâ€™s condition and adjust treatments as necessary. This helps in preventing renal and endocrine issues, as well as monitoring cardiovascular health.
### Conclusion
The protocol helps streamline the process of monitoring essential lab tests for diabetic patients. It automatically identifies missed tests and generates recommendations for follow-up. The automated alerts and recommendations reduce the administrative burden on healthcare providers, allowing them to focus more on patient care and less on tracking test compliance manually.
