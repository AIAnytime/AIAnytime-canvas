# Google Calendar Integration

## A smarter way to schedule
- Set provider availability in Canvas using events in gCal with one way syncing from Google to Canvas
- Save time scheduling availability and blocks by layering multiple calendars in a single view.
- Use recurring events to set clinic availability and one-off events to block time as needed.
- Manage users to ensure calendars are maintained by those with the right permissions.
