# Screening for Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes in Adults
## Purpose of the protocol

To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults.

## Target population
- if age >= 35 years and <= 70 years
- if overweight or if BMI >= 25 kg/mÂ²
- if greater risk factors like family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance

## Recommendation
The USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity. Clinicians should offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions.

## Importance
- Prevalence: Diabetes affects approximately 13% of all US adults, and type 2 diabetes constitutes 90% to 95% of all diabetes cases.
- Health Risks: Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are associated with cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and an increased risk of mortality.
- Cost: Early detection and intervention can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes, reducing healthcare costs and long-term complications.

## Conclusion
There is moderate certainty that screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, with subsequent preventive interventions for persons identified with prediabetes, have a moderate net benefit in reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular events and other complications. The harms of screening and preventive interventions are minimal.
