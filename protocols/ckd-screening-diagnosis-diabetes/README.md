# Screening and Diagnostic Workflow for CKD in Diabetic Patients

This protocol details the screening and diagnostic workflows for evaluating diabetic patients for possible chronic kidney disease (CKD) and classifying CKD if present. The process involves annual screenings, repeated testing for abnormal results, classification of CKD stages, and appropriate referrals and treatment.

## Summary of Protocol

### Protocol

1. **Annual Screening**
   - Check urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR).
   - Calculate eGFR using the CKD-EPI equation.
2. **Interpret Results**
   - **Normal Results**: UACR < 30 mg/g and eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²
     - Continue normal monitoring with annual checks.
   - **Abnormal Results**: UACR ≥ 30 mg/g or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²
     - Repeat testing (2 out of 3 samples within 3-6 months).
3. **Classify CKD if Abnormal Results Persist**
   - **Stage 1-2 CKD**: eGFR ≥ 60, UACR ≥ 30 mg/g
     - Manage CKD with RAS blockers, SGLT2 inhibitors, glycemic control, and BP management.
   - **Stage 3-5 CKD**: eGFR < 60
     - Refer to a nephrologist for specialized care.
4. **Monitor Progression**
   - Regular monitoring to assess CKD progression and adjust treatment as necessary.

## Important Details and Considerations

- **Measurement Variability**: Due to high biological variability, two of three UACR specimens collected within a 3-6 month period should be abnormal before diagnosing CKD.
- **Screening Frequency**: Both albuminuria and eGFR should be monitored annually for timely CKD diagnosis and management.
- **Treatment Adjustments**: Specific treatment options, such as the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, should be considered based on individual patient risk factors and CKD stages.
- **Referral Thresholds**: Refer patients to nephrologists when eGFR is <30 mL/min/1.73 m² or when there are difficult management issues or rapidly progressing kidney disease.
