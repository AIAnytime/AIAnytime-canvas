# Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening: Final Recommendation
## Purpose of the protocol
To update recommendations on the screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) using ultrasonography in asymptomatic adults aged 50 years or older, based on the evidence of its benefits and harms.

## Target population
- Men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked: age >= 65 && age <=75 && (smoking_history == True)
- Men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked: age >= 65 && age <=75 && (smoking_history == False)
- Women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA: age >= 65 && age <=75 && ((smoking_history == True) || (family_history_aaa == True))
- Women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA: age >= 65 && age <=75 && (smoking_history == False) && (family_history_aaa == False)
## Recommendation
- Screen men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked for AAA with a one-time ultrasonography screening.
- Selectively offer screening for AAA with ultrasonography for men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked, rather than routinely screening all men in this group.
- Do not screen women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA.
- Evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA.
## Importance
- AAA is an aortic enlargement with a diameter of 3.0 cm or larger.
- The prevalence of AAA has declined over the past 2 decades due to a decrease in smoking prevalence.
- Most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture, which has a high risk of death.
- Key risk factors for AAA include older age, male sex, smoking, and having a first-degree relative with AAA.
- The prevalence of AAA in women is significantly lower than in men.
## Conclusion
The evidence supports a moderate net benefit from one-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked, owing to the reduction in AAA-related mortality and emergency surgeries. Screening men in this age group who have never smoked is of small net benefit, and decisions should be individualized. Routine screening in women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA is not recommended, and for women who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA, evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms.
