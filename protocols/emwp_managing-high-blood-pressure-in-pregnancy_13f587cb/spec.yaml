  - title: "Protocol for Managing High-Risk Preeclampsia in Pregnant Women"
    description: "This protocol outlines the management of high blood pressure in pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia. It includes criteria for initial population, high-risk screening, and exclusion. Diagnostic interventions involve regular monitoring of blood pressure, urine protein, and blood tests, along with fetal assessments. Successful management is defined by controlled blood pressure, absence of significant proteinuria, normal lab results, and fetal well-being. The protocol aims to ensure maternal and fetal safety through early identification and management of preeclampsia risks."
