### Target Population
Patients who have undergone a PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) screening. Suitable for patients being monitored for depression or at risk of depressive disorders.
### Recommendations
Automatic monitoring the results of PHQ-9 screenings. If a patient's PHQ-9 score is 20 or higher, or if the answer to Question 9 (which assesses suicidal thoughts) indicates a concern, it triggers an alert. Specifically:
- High Score Alert: A score of 20 or higher on the PHQ-9.
- Suicidal Thoughts Alert: Positive response to Question 9 about suicidal thoughts.
When these conditions are met, the protocol creates a follow-up task for the care team to ensure timely intervention.
### Importance
Depression is a serious condition that requires timely follow-up to provide appropriate care and prevent worsening of the patientâ€™s condition. By automating the monitoring and task creation process:
- Improved Patient Safety: Ensures that high-risk patients receive timely follow-up.
- Enhanced Workflow Efficiency: Reduces manual tracking and task management, allowing clinicians to focus on direct patient care.
### Conclusion
Management of depression screenings by automating the identification of high-risk patients and ensuring follow-up actions are promptly taken. It reduces the risk of missed critical follow-ups and supports the care team in providing timely and effective interventions.
