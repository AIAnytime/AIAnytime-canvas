### Target Population
Designed for patients with Type 2 Diabetes, particularly those who are already on glucose-lowering therapy or who meet specific criteria for adjusting their treatment. This includes patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 27, and those with heart failure or chronic kidney disease.

### Recommendations
  1. GLP-1 Agonists: For patients with a BMI > 27 who are not already on a GLP-1 medication, the protocol recommends starting or switching to a GLP-1 agonist.
  2. SGLT-2 Inhibitors: For patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease who are not already on an SGLT-2 inhibitor, the protocol suggests starting or switching to this class of medication.
  3. Titration and Insulin: The protocol advises titrating existing therapy to the maximum tolerable dose and adding basal insulin if fasting blood glucose levels or A1c are persistently elevated.

### Importance
Optimize glucose management in Type 2 Diabetes by personalizing treatment based on patient characteristics such as BMI and comorbid conditions like heart failure and chronic kidney disease. By ensuring patients receive the most appropriate medication, the protocol helps in achieving better glycemic control and potentially improves patient outcomes.

### Conclusion
Patients with Type 2 Diabetes receive targeted therapy adjustments based on their specific needs and conditions. Clinicians are guided to either start or switch to effective medications and make adjustments based on ongoing glucose monitoring. Designed to enhance patient care, streamline treatment decisions, and potentially improve overall health outcomes for patients with complex diabetes management needs.

Effect on Clinician Workflow

- Streamlined Decision-Making: Provides clear recommendations for medication adjustments, reducing the need for time-consuming decision-making processes.
- Automated Monitoring: Helps clinicians automatically track and adjust treatments based on patient data such as BMI, A1c levels, and existing conditions.
- Enhanced Patient Care: Ensures that patients receive timely adjustments to their therapy, potentially leading to better management of diabetes and associated conditions.
