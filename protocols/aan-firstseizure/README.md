# Clinical Guideline for Adults with an Unprovoked First Seizure
**Developed by**: American Academy of Neurology
**Description**:
This corresponds to the guideline published by the AAN on the management of a first seizure

## Recurrence Risk
- Greatest within the first 2 years: 21%â€“45% (Level A)
- Increased risk factors:
  - Prior brain insult (Level A)
  - EEG with epileptiform abnormalities (Level A)
  - Significant brain-imaging abnormality (Level B)
  - Nocturnal seizure (Level B)

## AED Therapy
- Immediate AED therapy:
  - Reduces recurrence risk within the first 2 years (Level B)
  - May not improve quality of life (Level C)
  - Unlikely to improve long-term prognosis (>3 years) for sustained seizure remission (Level B)
  
## Adverse Events (AEs)
- Risk of AED AEs: 7% to 31% (Level B)
- AEs are likely predominantly mild and reversible

## Recommendations
- Decisions to initiate immediate AED treatment should be individualized:
  - Weigh recurrence risk against AEs
  - Consider patient preferences
  - Inform that immediate treatment reduces 2-year seizure risk but does not improve long-term remission prognosis
