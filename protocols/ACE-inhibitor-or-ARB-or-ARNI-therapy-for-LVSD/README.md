# Heart Failure Protocol: ACE Inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI Therapy for LVSD
## Purpose of the protocol
The purpose of this protocol is to ensure that patients with heart failure (HF) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) are prescribed appropriate medications—ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or ARNIs—to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with HF.

## Target population
- Adult patients diagnosed with heart failure (HF)
    - age >= 18 years
    - LVEF < 40%
## Recommendation
- Prescribe ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI therapy to eligible HF patients within a 12-month period during outpatient follow-up or at each hospital discharge.
## Importance
- Morbidity and Mortality Reduction: Reduces the risk of death and hospitalization in patients with HF and LVSD.
- Guideline Adherence: Ensures alignment with established clinical guidelines for HF management.
- Quality Improvement: Enhances the quality of care provided to HF patients, improving overall healthcare outcomes.
- Symptom Management: Helps manage symptoms more effectively in HF patients, improving their quality of life.
## Conclusion
Implementation of this protocol ensures that eligible patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction receive evidence-based medical therapy known to improve survival and reduce hospital admissions. Regular adherence to prescribing these medications ensures standardized, high-quality care for HF patients across various healthcare settings.
