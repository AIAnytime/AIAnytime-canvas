# Summary of Protocol for Managing High Blood Pressure in Pregnant Women at High Risk of Developing Preeclampsia

The protocol aims to ensure the safety and well-being of both the mother and the fetus by early identification and management of high blood pressure and associated risks of preeclampsia in pregnant women.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of pregnant women aged 18 years and older with a singleton pregnancy who present with high blood pressure at any point during pregnancy. From this group, a subset of women with high-risk factors for developing preeclampsia is considered for further screening. The protocol outlines specific exclusion criteria to ensure appropriate management within its scope. Diagnostic interventions are recommended to monitor and assess the health of both the mother and the fetus. Conditions for successful management are defined to guide treatment and ensure positive outcomes.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population**: 
  - Pregnant women aged 18 years and older.
  - Women with a singleton pregnancy.
  - Women with high blood pressure (systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg).

- **High-Risk Factors for Screening**:
  - History of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy.
  - Chronic hypertension.
  - Pre-existing diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2).
  - Renal disease.
  - Autoimmune disorders (e.g., lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome).
  - Multiple gestation (twins or more).
  - Obesity (BMI ≥ 30).
  - Advanced maternal age (≥ 35 years).

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Contraindications to antihypertensive medications.
  - Severe comorbid conditions requiring specialized management.
  - Non-compliance with prenatal care visits.
  - Known fetal anomalies incompatible with life.

- **Diagnostic Interventions**:
  - Regular blood pressure monitoring at each prenatal visit.
  - Urine protein testing for proteinuria.
  - Blood tests: complete blood count, liver and renal function tests.
  - Ultrasound assessments for fetal growth and amniotic fluid levels.
  - Non-stress tests or biophysical profiles as needed.

- **Conditions for Successful Management**:
  - Blood pressure consistently below 140/90 mmHg.
  - Absence of significant proteinuria (protein/creatinine ratio < 0.3 mg/mg or 24-hour urine protein < 300 mg).
  - Normal laboratory test results indicating stable liver and renal function.
  - Evidence of normal fetal growth and well-being on ultrasound.
  - No signs or symptoms of severe preeclampsia (e.g., severe headache, visual disturbances, epigastric pain).

This protocol is designed to provide a structured approach to managing high blood pressure in pregnant women at high risk of preeclampsia, ensuring timely intervention and monitoring to protect maternal and fetal health.
