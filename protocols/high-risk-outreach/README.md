## Target Population
Patients aged 65 and older with active diagnoses of chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, immunocompromised conditions, ischemic vascular disease, kidney failure, morbid obesity, or persistent asthma.

## Recommendations
Administer a COVID-19 outreach questionnaire to high risk patients to assess their risk and ensure they receive appropriate follow-up care.

## Importance
Older adults with significant health conditions are actively monitored for COVID-19 risks. 

## Conclusion
The `Ccp002v1` protocol automates the process of identifying and following up with high-risk patients by analyzing their medical records and conditions. It checks if patients have completed a COVID-19 questionnaire and, if they haven't, sends reminders to clinicians to make contact.
