# Summary of Cholesterol Management Protocol

The goal of this protocol is to effectively manage cholesterol levels in adults to prevent hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. It provides a structured approach for screening, diagnosis, and management, emphasizing lifestyle changes and potential pharmacological interventions.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes adults aged 20 years and older without a prior diagnosis of hyperlipidemia or cardiovascular disease. A subset of this population is considered for screening based on risk factors such as family history, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, or a sedentary lifestyle. Exclusion criteria are clearly defined to ensure the protocol is applied to appropriate individuals, excluding pregnant individuals, those on lipid-lowering medication, those with allergies to such medications, and those with recent acute illnesses or surgeries.

Diagnostic interventions include a fasting lipid panel to measure cholesterol levels, assessment of lifestyle factors, blood pressure measurement, and BMI calculation. Successful screening is defined by specific cholesterol and triglyceride levels, along with the identification of modifiable lifestyle factors.

Key recommendations include lifestyle modification counseling for individuals with abnormal lipid panel results, focusing on dietary changes, increased physical activity, and smoking cessation. Pharmacological intervention is considered for those with significantly elevated cholesterol levels or those unresponsive to lifestyle changes. Regular follow-ups every 3-6 months are advised to monitor cholesterol levels and adjust management plans.
