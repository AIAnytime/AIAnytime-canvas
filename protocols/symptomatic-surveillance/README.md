## Target Population
The Ccp001v1 protocol targets patients who completed a COVID-19 questionnaire between 5 and 7 days ago. This includes individuals who may need follow-up based on their questionnaire responses, focusing on recent symptoms, travel, or exposure, particularly among older patients.

## Recommendations
The protocol provides the following recommendations:

 - For patients needing follow-up: If the patient’s responses indicate a need for follow-up (e.g., symptoms, recent travel, or exposure), the protocol suggests arranging a follow-up appointment. The recommendation includes a narrative detailing why follow-up is necessary.
 - For patients not needing follow-up: It confirms that no additional follow-up is required if the patient’s responses do not indicate any significant issues.
## Importance
This protocol ensures that patients who have recently completed a COVID-19 questionnaire are appropriately followed up. By automating the review of questionnaire responses and generating follow-up recommendations, it helps clinicians manage patient care more effectively and ensures that no high-risk patients are overlooked.

## Conclusion
The Ccp001v1 protocol automates the management of follow-up care for patients who completed a COVID-19 questionnaire within the past week. It assesses the need for further action based on questionnaire responses, including symptoms, recent travel, or exposure. This integration into the clinical workflow helps streamline follow-up processes, ensuring timely and appropriate care for patients while reducing the administrative burden on clinicians.
