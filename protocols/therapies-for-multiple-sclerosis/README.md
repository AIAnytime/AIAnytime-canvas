# Practice Guideline Recommendations Summary: Disease-modifying Therapies for Adults with Multiple Sclerosis
## Purpose of the protocol
The purpose of this protocol is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians on the initiation, switching, and discontinuation of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in adults with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

## Target population
- Individuals with MS, covering:
age == adults
- MS type == RRMS, SPMS, or PPMS
- Women pregnancy_status == planning or current
- Patients with serious infections == true or malignancy == true
## Recommendation
- Initiation: Evaluate risk factors and disease activity before initiating DMT. Clinicians should start DMTs in patients recently diagnosed with MS, those with a single demyelinating event plus brain lesions characteristic of MS, and patients with recent relapses or MRI activity.
- Switching: Switch DMTs if patients experience adverse effects, intolerance, or lack of efficacy. Discuss switching to a non-injectable or less frequently injectable DMT for those experiencing injection fatigue.
- Discontinuation: Counsel stable patients on the need for ongoing follow-up if they wish to discontinue treatment. Discontinuation can be considered in SPMS patients without recent relapses.
## Importance
- Enhanced Patient Outcomes: Ensures patients receive optimal therapy tailored to their specific condition and response to treatment.
- Safety and Tolerability: Addresses the management of adverse effects and risks associated with long-term DMT use.
- Shared Decision Making: Emphasizes the inclusion of patient preferences and lifestyle considerations in treatment decisions.
- Disease Monitoring: Mandates regular disease activity monitoring through MRI to guide treatment adjustments.
## Conclusion
These guidelines underscore the necessity of individualized treatment strategies in MS care to improve patient quality of life, minimize adverse effects, and manage disease progression effectively. The recommendations highlight the importance of regular monitoring, patient counseling, and the need for flexibility in treatment plans based on evolving patient circumstances and new clinical evidence.
