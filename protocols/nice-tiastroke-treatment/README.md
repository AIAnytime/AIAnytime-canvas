# NICE guideline for Parkinson's disease: Stroke and transient ischaemic attack in over 16s: diagnosis and initial management

**Developed by**: National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)

## Thrombolysis with Alteplase

1. **Conditions for Alteplase:**
   - Start treatment within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.
   - Exclude intracranial haemorrhage by imaging.

2. **Administration Environment:**
   - Well-organized stroke service with:
     - Trained staff for thrombolysis and monitoring complications.
     - Nursing staff for level 1 and 2 care.
     - Immediate access to imaging and trained staff to interpret images.
     - Protocols for managing intravenous thrombolysis and complications.

3. **Emergency Department:**
   - Can administer if appropriately trained and supported, provided patients are managed within an acute stroke service.

## Thrombectomy

1. **Within 6 Hours of Symptom Onset:**
   - Offer with intravenous thrombolysis (if not contraindicated and within the licensed time window).
   - Confirmed proximal anterior circulation occlusion by CTA or MRA.

2. **Between 6 to 24 Hours from Last Known Well:**
   - Offer if:
     - Confirmed proximal anterior circulation occlusion by CTA or MRA.
     - Potential to salvage brain tissue shown by CT perfusion or diffusion-weighted MRI.

3. **Up to 24 Hours from Last Known Well:**
   - Consider if:
     - Confirmed proximal posterior circulation occlusion by CTA or MRA.
     - Potential to salvage brain tissue shown by CT perfusion or diffusion-weighted MRI.

4. **Clinical Status Consideration:**
   - Pre-stroke functional status < 3 on modified Rankin scale.
   - NIHSS score > 5.
