## Put patients first in how you communicate
- HIPAA compliant text messages that direct patients to their unique logins to the patient app
- Automated reminders for appointments save time and frustration for patients and staff and help to keep important preventive care and screenings on track.
- Alert patients to newly added results and messages from their care team.
- Engage with your customers using a verified local identity (a local phone number).
- Brands and campaigns are registered to ensure A2P (Application to Person) 10DLC (10 digit long code)compliance.
