#  Screening for Osteoporosis to Prevent Fractures
## Purpose of the protocol

To update the 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and older men to prevent osteoporotic fractures.

## Target population
- if gender == female and age >= 65 years (postmenopausal women)
if gender == female and age < 65 years and has ≥ 1 risk factor for osteoporosis (e.g., parental history of hip fracture)
- if gender == male and age >= 70 years
- if age >= 50 years and has ≥ 1 increased risk (e.g., previous fracture, chronic corticosteroid use)

## Recommendation
The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women age 65 years and older and in younger women whose fracture risk is equal to or greater than that of a 65-year-old white woman who has no additional risk factors.

## Importance
- Prevalence: Osteoporosis is a significant public health issue, affecting millions of older adults in the United States.
- Health Risks: Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures, which can lead to serious health consequences, including chronic pain, disability, diminished quality of life, and increased mortality.
- Cost: Osteoporotic fractures result in substantial healthcare costs and resources.

## Conclusion
Bone measurement testing is effective in identifying osteoporosis and reducing the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women and older adults at higher risk. Screening for osteoporosis enables timely interventions that can mitigate the risks associated with osteoporotic fractures, with minimal harms from the screening itself.
