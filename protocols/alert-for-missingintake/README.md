### Target Population
This protocol is designed for patients in behavioral health settings who have pending appointments and have not yet completed their intake questionnaire.

### Recommendations
If the `BehavioralHealthIntakeQuestionnaire`  questionnaire is not completed, and the upcoming apppointment is scheduled within 72 hours, a task is generated for the care coordination team to reach out and ensure the intake form is completed.

### Importance
Completing the intake questionnaire is crucial in behavioral health, as it gathers essential patient information before the appointment. This protocol ensures that no patient is seen without this vital information, which helps clinicians make informed decisions and provides a better patient experience. Automating this process reduces the manual burden on clinicians, allowing them to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks.

### Conclusion
By implementing this protocol, clinics can improve the efficiency and quality of care by ensuring that intake questionnaires are completed timely. This automation supports clinicians by reducing the risk of missing critical patient information, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and clinic workflow.
