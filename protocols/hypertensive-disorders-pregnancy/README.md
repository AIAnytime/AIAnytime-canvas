# Screening for Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy

## Purpose of the protocol
To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to improve maternal and fetal health outcomes.

## Target population
- if pregnant
- if unknown chronic hypertension status or known chronic hypertension
- if gestational age >= 20 weeks

## Recommendation
The USPSTF recommends screening with blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy to detect hypertensive disorders of pregnancy early and manage them effectively.

## Importance
- Prevalence: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in the US.
- Health Risks: Serious maternal morbidities include cerebrovascular accidents, retinal detachment, organ damage or failure, and eclamptic seizures. Adverse perinatal outcomes include intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, and stillbirth.
- Disparities: Black individuals have higher rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preeclampsia-related complications compared to White individuals.

## Conclusion
There is moderate certainty that screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy with blood pressure measurements provides a substantial net benefit by reducing maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. The harms of screening and intervention are minimal.
