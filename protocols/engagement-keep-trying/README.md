### Target Population
Patients who have not had an annual assessment, have had more than five phone call attempts, do not have a scheduled appointment, are not marked as "not interested," are English speakers, and do not have an engagement/transition task assigned.
### Recommendations
Continuous efforts to engage with these patients by calling them at least once more within the week. If a phone call has been made within the past week, the protocol suggests scheduling a follow-up attempt for the following week. This approach ensures that patients who are difficult to reach or have been overlooked are systematically followed up on.
### Importance
Essential for improving patient engagement and ensuring that individuals who have missed their annual assessment are appropriately followed up. By targeting those who have not yet been assessed and have shown a potential need for continued outreach, the protocol helps to increase the likelihood of completing important annual evaluations and maintaining patient care continuity.
### Conclusion
Optimizes clinician workflow by providing clear guidelines for following up with patients who meet specific criteria. Streamlining the process of identifying and contacting patients who require additional outreach, thus improving the overall efficiency of patient engagement efforts. By automating the identification and scheduling of follow-up tasks, clinicians can focus on providing care rather than managing administrative details.
