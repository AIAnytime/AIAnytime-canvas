### Target Population
The protocol is designed for patients who have experienced their first unprovoked seizure. This includes individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of a first seizure based on SNOMED CT codes (371114002) or ICD-10 codes (G4089).
### Recommendations
For patients in this population, the protocol ensures they receive essential guidance about seizure management. Specifically, it checks if the patient has been given initial seizure advice. If not, the protocol prompts clinicians to discuss the risk of seizure recurrence and provides a recommendation to instruct the patient about the potential for recurrence within the first two years.
### Importance
This protocol is critical for ensuring that patients who have had their first seizure receive timely and appropriate educational information. Following the AAN (American Academy of Neurology) guidelines, it helps in maintaining a high standard of care by ensuring that all necessary instructions are provided. This can improve patient outcomes by better preparing them for the risks associated with seizures.
### Conclusion
The "First Unprovoked Seizure Protocol" automates the process of verifying whether patients have been instructed about their condition, based on the latest guidelines. It streamlines clinician workflow by automating reminders and providing specific recommendations when actions are needed. By integrating this protocol into clinical practice, healthcare providers can enhance their efficiency in managing patients with first seizures, ensuring consistent adherence to recommended care practices.
