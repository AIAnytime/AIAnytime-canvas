# Ocular Prophylaxis for Gonococcal Ophthalmia Neonatorum

## Purpose of the protocol
To reaffirm the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2011 recommendation on ocular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.

## Target population
- Newborns

## Recommendation
The USPSTF recommends prophylactic ocular topical medication for all newborns to prevent gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.

## Importance
- Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum rates are estimated at 0.4 cases per 100,000 live births per year in the United States.
- Can cause severe outcomes like corneal scarring, ocular perforation, and blindness within 24 hours after birth.
- Without prophylaxis, transmission rates from mother to newborn range between 30% to 50%.

## Conclusion
There is convincing evidence that topical ocular prophylaxis for all newborns provides substantial benefit and is not associated with serious harms.
