# Summary of Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically screen for side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists to ensure patient safety and effective management of potential adverse effects.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients currently on GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and albiglutide. It then narrows down to a subset of patients who have been on these medications for at least four weeks and have not had a side effect screening in the past three months. Exclusion criteria are outlined to ensure the protocol is applied to appropriate candidates, excluding those with allergies, contraindications, or those in acute care settings.

The diagnostic interventions involve a comprehensive review of the patient's medical history and symptoms, administering a standardized questionnaire to assess common side effects, and performing laboratory tests if necessary. The protocol concludes with conditions for successful screens, emphasizing the importance of documenting side effects, communicating findings to patients, and establishing follow-up plans.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population**: All patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and albiglutide.
  
- **Subset for Screening**: Patients on GLP-1 medications for at least four weeks and without a side effect screening in the last three months.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Patients with allergies or contraindications to GLP-1 medications.
  - Patients currently hospitalized or in acute care settings.
  - Patients who have discontinued GLP-1 medications for over four weeks before the screening date.

- **Diagnostic Interventions**:
  - Review of medical history and current symptoms.
  - Standardized questionnaire for common side effects: gastrointestinal symptoms, injection site reactions, signs of pancreatitis or thyroid tumors.
  - Laboratory tests if symptoms indicate, such as serum amylase and lipase for suspected pancreatitis.

- **Conditions for Successful Screens**:
  - Documenting any side effects experienced by the patient.
  - Communicating findings and educating patients on potential side effects and management.
  - Recommending consultation with a healthcare provider if significant side effects are identified.
  - Establishing a follow-up plan for patients with identified side effects, including possible medication adjustment or discontinuation.
