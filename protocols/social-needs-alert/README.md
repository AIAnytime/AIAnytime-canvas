### Target Population
Patients undergoing behavioral health intake surveys, particularly focusing on those who may have social needs affecting their well-being.
### Recommendations
When a patient completes a behavioral health intake questionnaire, this protocol automatically checks for responses indicating social needs, such as unemployment, food insecurity, or housing worries. If such needs are identified, it creates a task for the care coordinator team to follow up with the patient.
### Importance
This protocol ensures that patients with identified social needs are promptly addressed by the care coordination team. It helps integrate social determinants of health into the care process, which can significantly impact patient outcomes and support a more holistic approach to healthcare.
### Conclusion
By automating the task creation for follow-up based on social needs identified in intake surveys, this protocol enhances workflow efficiency for clinicians and care coordinators. It reduces manual tracking efforts and ensures that patients receive timely support for their social needs, ultimately improving care coordination and patient outcomes.
