### Target Population
Patients who screen positive for prediabetes, specifically those with an A1c level between 5.7 and 6.4. Designed for patients who may require further management to prevent progression to diabetes. Relevant for those with additional risk factors such as a high BMI, a history of gestational diabetes, or elevated fasting glucose levels.
### Recommendations
1. Lifestyle Changes: Patients should be instructed on lifestyle modifications related to diet and exercise if they haven't received such guidance in the last six months.
2. A1c Testing: Patients should have their A1c levels checked every six months.
3. Metformin Prescription:
 - Start metformin immediately if the patient has a BMI over 35, a history of gestational diabetes, fasting glucose levels of 110 mg/dL or higher, or an A1c greater than 6%.
 - If the patient has previously received lifestyle recommendations but still has a prediabetic A1c level after six months, consider starting metformin.
### Importance
Managing prediabetes effectively is crucial to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes and its associated complications. This ensures that patients receive timely interventions based on their specific risk factors and treatment history. Clinicians can provide personalized care that addresses both lifestyle and pharmacological aspects of prediabetes management.
### Conclusion
A structured approach to managing prediabetes by combining lifestyle recommendations with pharmacological intervention when necessary. It ensures that patients are monitored and treated based on their risk factors and response to initial lifestyle modifications. For clinicians, this means streamlined decision-making with clear guidelines on when to initiate metformin and when to recommend lifestyle changes or further testing, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes.
