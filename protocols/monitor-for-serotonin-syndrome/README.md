### Target Population
Patients who are prescribed medications that could interact to increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Specifically, it monitors patients who are prescribed both bupropion and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). 
### Recommendations
The protocol ensures that if a patient is prescribed bupropion in conjunction with an SSRI or SNRI, they receive appropriate education about the risk of serotonin syndrome. It performs the following checks:
- Verifies if the patient is currently prescribed bupropion and whether they have previously taken it.
- Checks if the patient is also on an SSRI or SNRI, or has taken such medications previously.
- If the conditions are met, the system sends a notification to the patient portal with information about monitoring for serotonin syndrome.
### Importance
Serotonin syndrome is a potentially serious condition resulting from excessive serotonin in the brain. By educating patients about this risk when they are prescribed a combination of bupropion with SSRIs or SNRIs, it helps prevent adverse drug reactions and ensures patient safety.
### Conclusion
Streamlines the monitoring of patients at risk for serotonin syndrome. It automates the detection of potential high-risk medication combinations and sends timely notifications to patients, thereby reducing manual checks and improving efficiency.
