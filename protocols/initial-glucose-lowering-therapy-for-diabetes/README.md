### Target Population
Designed for patients with type 2 diabetes. Those who require initial glucose-lowering therapy including conditions such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or reduced life expectancy.
### Recommendations
  Glucose-lowering therapy based on individual patient conditions:
1. Metformin: Recommended as a first-line treatment unless contraindicated.
2. SGLT2 Inhibitors (e.g., Canagliflozin, Empagliflozin, Dapagliflozin): Suggested for patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease.
3. GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (e.g., Semaglutide): Considered based on patient-specific factors such as BMI and ASCVD risk.
### Importance
Diabetes management is optimized based on a patient's specific health conditions. By incorporating factors like A1c levels, comorbidities, and life expectancy. This helps in selecting the most appropriate therapy, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing complications associated with diabetes.
### Conclusion
Implementing this protocol could streamline clinician workflow by automating the decision-making process for initiating glucose-lowering therapies. It ensures that treatment decisions are based on comprehensive patient data, including A1c levels and other health conditions. By providing clear recommendations and facilitating prescription orders, the protocol aids in more efficient and personalized diabetes management.
