# Summary of Clinical Protocol for Monitoring Patients at Risk of Serotonin Syndrome

The primary goal of this clinical protocol is to ensure patient safety by identifying and managing the risk of serotonin syndrome in patients who are prescribed medications that may interact to increase serotonin levels.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients currently prescribed medications known to increase serotonin levels, such as SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and other serotonergic agents. From this group, a subset is considered for screening, focusing on patients who are also prescribed additional medications that could further elevate the risk of serotonin syndrome. These additional medications include triptans, certain opioids like tramadol and fentanyl, linezolid, lithium, and herbal supplements such as St. John's Wort.

Patients are excluded from the screening subset if they have a documented history of serotonin syndrome and are no longer on serotonergic medications, have been on a stable regimen of interacting medications for over six months without symptoms, or have contraindications to the diagnostic interventions.

The protocol outlines diagnostic interventions, including a comprehensive medication review to identify potential drug interactions, clinical assessments for symptoms of serotonin syndrome, and laboratory tests to rule out other causes of symptoms. Symptoms to be assessed include mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities.

A successful screen is defined by the identification and documentation of potential risk factors for serotonin syndrome, followed by appropriate clinical actions. These actions may include adjusting medication regimens, educating patients and caregivers about serotonin syndrome symptoms, implementing a monitoring plan for early detection, and referring to a specialist if necessary.

### Important Information:
- **Initial Population:** Patients on medications that increase serotonin levels.
- **Subset for Screening:** Patients on additional interacting medications.
- **Exclusion Criteria:** History of serotonin syndrome, stable medication regimen without symptoms, contraindications to interventions.
- **Diagnostic Interventions:** Medication review, clinical assessment, and laboratory tests.
- **Symptoms to Monitor:** Mental status changes, autonomic instability, neuromuscular abnormalities.
- **Successful Screen Actions:** Medication adjustments, patient education, monitoring plans, specialist referrals.
- **End Goal:** Proactively manage and reduce the risk of serotonin syndrome in at-risk patients.
