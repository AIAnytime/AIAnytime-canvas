### Target Population
Designed for patients who have undergone transsphenoidal surgery (TSS). This type of surgery is typically performed to remove pituitary tumors. The protocol identifies patients based on specific surgical codes (ICD-10-PCS, SNOMED CT, and CPT).
### Recommendations
The protocol recommends instructing patients to restrict their fluid intake to 1 liter per day for 7 days following their surgery. This recommendation is based on clinical evidence showing that such fluid restriction helps prevent the development of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), a common complication after TSS.
### Importance
Preventing SIADH is crucial in post-operative care for TSS patients. SIADH can lead to significant complications, including hyponatremia, which can cause confusion, seizures, and other severe neurological issues. By implementing this fluid restriction protocol, clinicians can reduce the risk of SIADH, improving patient outcomes and reducing the likelihood of extended hospital stays or readmissions.
### Conclusion
This protocol integrates into the clinical workflow by automatically identifying eligible patients who have recently undergone transsphenoidal surgery and providing clinicians with a prompt to recommend fluid restriction. By doing so, it helps standardize post-operative care, ensuring that all patients receive the necessary guidance to prevent SIADH, thereby improving overall patient safety and clinical outcomes.
