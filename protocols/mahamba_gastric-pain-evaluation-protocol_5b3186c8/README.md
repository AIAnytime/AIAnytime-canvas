# Summary of Clinical Protocol for Evaluating Gastric Pain in Patients Without Risk Factors

The primary goal of this clinical protocol is to provide a structured approach for evaluating gastric pain in adults who do not present with known risk factors for gastric conditions. The protocol aims to identify underlying causes of gastric pain and ensure effective treatment and symptom resolution.

The protocol begins by defining the initial population, which includes adults aged 18 years and older who present with gastric pain but have no known risk factors such as a history of peptic ulcer disease, family history of gastric cancer, use of NSAIDs, or Helicobacter pylori infection. From this initial population, a subset is considered for screening if they experience persistent gastric pain lasting more than two weeks and have not found relief from over-the-counter antacids or dietary changes.

Exclusion criteria are clearly outlined to ensure that patients with known risk factors, alarm symptoms (e.g., unexplained weight loss, persistent vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, or anemia), a history of gastric surgery, known gastrointestinal disorders, or pregnancy are not included in the protocol.

The diagnostic interventions are structured in a stepwise manner:

1. **Initial Assessment**: This includes a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, and basic laboratory tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) and metabolic panel.

2. **Non-Invasive Testing**: If the initial assessment does not provide conclusive results, non-invasive tests such as a urea breath test or stool antigen test for Helicobacter pylori, and an abdominal ultrasound are recommended to rule out gallbladder disease or other abdominal pathologies.

3. **Further Evaluation**: If initial and non-invasive tests remain inconclusive, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is advised to visually inspect the stomach lining and obtain biopsies if necessary.

The conditions for successful screens are defined as the identification of any underlying cause of gastric pain, such as Helicobacter pylori infection, gastritis, or non-ulcer dyspepsia. Successful outcomes also include symptom resolution or significant improvement following targeted treatment, clear documentation of findings and treatment plans in the patient's medical record, and an established follow-up plan to monitor symptom resolution and prevent recurrence.

Important points to note:
- The protocol is specifically designed for adults without known risk factors for gastric conditions.
- Persistent gastric pain and lack of relief from common remedies are key criteria for further screening.
- Exclusion criteria are comprehensive, ensuring that only appropriate patients are evaluated under this protocol.
- The diagnostic process is methodical, starting with basic assessments and progressing to more invasive procedures if necessary.
- Successful screening is not only about identifying the cause but also ensuring effective treatment and follow-up.
