### Target Population
Patients scheduled for new appointments where the reason for the visit includes anxiety or depression. Suitable for individuals who have not completed the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) or GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) questionnaires in the last two months.
### Recommendations
- For Patients: Complete the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 questionnaires if you have an upcoming appointment for anxiety or depression and have not done so in the last two months.
- For Clinicians: Ensure that patients are reminded to complete these questionnaires if they have not done so recently before their appointment for anxiety or depression.
### Importance
Accurate and up-to-date screening for anxiety and depression is crucial for effective treatment planning and follow-up. This protocol helps ensure that necessary assessments are completed timely, which can lead to more informed clinical decisions and better patient outcomes.
### Conclusion
The protocol automates the process of checking whether a patient has completed the required questionnaires before their appointment. If the patient has not completed them in the past two months, it sends a notification via webhook to prompt the completion of these assessments. This reduces manual tracking efforts for clinicians and helps in maintaining up-to-date patient records, thereby improving the efficiency of patient care.
