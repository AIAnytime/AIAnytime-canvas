### Appropriate Patient Populations for AUDIT-C

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C) questionnaire is particularly suitable for adult patient populations, including those seen in primary care, mental health services, and substance abuse treatment programs. Designed as a concise screen, the AUDIT-C is adept at flagging risky drinking behaviors, alcohol abuse, and potential dependence across various demographics. Though versatile in its applicability, it is generally recommended for use in individuals aged 18 and over. The simplicity and brevity of the questionnaire make it an optimal choice for routine screenings, allowing healthcare providers to efficiently identify individuals who may benefit from more extensive evaluations or interventions related to alcohol consumption.

### Utilization of AUDIT-C Results for Diagnosis and Treatment

The results of the AUDIT-C questionnaire play a vital role in both diagnostic and treatment processes. Scoring the questionnaire allows healthcare practitioners to quickly assess the severity of a patient's alcohol consumption. Scores typically range from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of hazardous drinking behaviors and alcohol use disorders. Clinicians can use these scores to determine the need for further diagnostic evaluations, potentially leading to a formal diagnosis. Moreover, the results inform treatment decisions and care plans, fostering early intervention. For example, patients identified as engaging in risky drinking may be counseled on moderation and referred to support programs, whereas those with high AUDIT-C scores might warrant more intensive interventions, such as brief counseling sessions, behavioral therapies, or specialized treatment for alcohol dependence.

### Validation and Authorship of the AUDIT-C

The AUDIT-C questionnaire is a derivative of the original Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), which was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a standardized tool for detecting alcohol consumption patterns and related disorders. The AUDIT-C specifically focuses on the consumption aspect, making it a more streamlined version for quick screenings. Extensive research has validated the efficacy and reliability of the AUDIT-C in various healthcare settings. Studies have demonstrated that it maintains a high sensitivity and specificity for identifying at-risk drinking behaviors and alcohol use disorders. Moreover, its validation across diverse populations ensures that it is a robust and reliable tool for clinicians globally. As a LOINC-coded instrument (72109-2 for the questionnaire and 75626-2 for scoring), it integrates seamlessly into electronic health records (EHRs), facilitating ease of use and consistent application in clinical practice.
