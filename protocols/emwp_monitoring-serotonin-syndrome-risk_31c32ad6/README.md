# Summary of Clinical Protocol for Monitoring Patients at Risk of Serotonin Syndrome

The primary goal of this clinical protocol is to identify and mitigate the risk of serotonin syndrome in patients prescribed serotonergic medications, thereby enhancing patient safety and outcomes.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients currently prescribed medications that increase serotonin levels, such as SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and other serotonergic agents. From this group, a subset is considered for screening, focusing on patients concurrently prescribed additional medications that may interact to heighten the risk of serotonin syndrome. These interacting medications include other serotonergic drugs, certain opioids like tramadol and fentanyl, triptans, linezolid, and St. John's Wort.

Patients are excluded from the screening subset if they have a documented history of serotonin syndrome and are no longer on interacting medications, have discontinued all serotonergic medications for at least 30 days, or are under palliative care where the risk is outweighed by symptom management benefits.

For those in the screening subset, the protocol recommends several diagnostic interventions. These include a comprehensive medication review to identify potential drug interactions, a clinical assessment for symptoms of serotonin syndrome, and laboratory tests to rule out other causes of symptoms.

A screen is deemed successful if potential drug interactions are identified and addressed through medication adjustment or discontinuation, patients are educated about the signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, and follow-up assessments are scheduled to monitor for symptom development in patients who continue on interacting medications.

### Important Information:
- **Initial Population:** Patients on medications that increase serotonin levels.
- **Screening Subset:** Patients on additional interacting medications.
- **Exclusion Criteria:** History of serotonin syndrome, discontinuation of serotonergic medications, or palliative care.
- **Diagnostic Interventions:** Medication review, clinical assessment, and laboratory tests.
- **Successful Screen Conditions:** Addressing drug interactions, patient education, and follow-up assessments.
- **Goal:** Proactively identify and mitigate serotonin syndrome risk to improve patient safety.
