# Return-to-Play Protocol for Sports-Related Concussions

This protocol provides guidelines for managing sports-related concussions to ensure the safe return of athletes to activity. It outlines a stepwise approach from initial assessment to full return to play, emphasizing individualized care and symptom monitoring.

The protocol applies to individuals suspected of having a concussion sustained during sports activities.  It guides healthcare professionals through assessment, management, and a graduated return-to-play (RTP) progression. Individuals with moderate to severe TBI, pre-existing neurological conditions, or suspected cervical spine injury are excluded and require specialized management.

The protocol begins with immediate removal from play and a comprehensive assessment encompassing symptom evaluation, neurological examination, and cognitive assessment.  Physical and cognitive rest are prescribed initially, followed by symptom monitoring and education for the athlete and their family.  The core of the protocol is a six-stage graduated RTP progression:

1. **Symptom-Limited Activity:** Light aerobic exercise that doesn't exacerbate symptoms.
2. **Light Aerobic Exercise:** Increased intensity and duration of aerobic exercise; introduction of sport-specific movements without contact.
3. **Sport-Specific Exercise:** More complex drills with increased intensity and duration, still without contact.
4. **Non-Contact Training Drills:** Participation in regular training activities with the team, excluding contact.
5. **Full Contact Practice:** Return to full contact practice after medical clearance.
6. **Return to Play:** Return to full competition.

Each stage lasts at least 24 hours, and any symptom recurrence requires returning to the previous asymptomatic stage.  Medical clearance for full return to play is granted by a healthcare professional after successful completion of all stages without symptoms.  Thorough documentation of all aspects of the process is essential.

Key takeaways include:

* **Immediate Removal from Play:** Suspected concussion requires immediate removal.
* **Comprehensive Assessment:**  Includes symptom, neurological, and cognitive evaluation.
* **Rest and Monitoring:** Initial physical and cognitive rest with ongoing symptom monitoring.
* **Graduated RTP:** Stepwise progression with increasing activity levels and monitoring for symptom recurrence.
* **Medical Clearance:** Final clearance required by a healthcare professional experienced in concussion management.
* **Documentation:**  Detailed record-keeping throughout the entire process.
