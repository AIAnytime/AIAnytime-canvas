### Target Population
Patients over 40 years old who have type 2 diabetes. Targeting those who are not currently on a statin medication.
### Recommendations
Initiating statin therapy for patients meeting the criteria (i.e., age > 40 and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes).  Standard treatment is moderate-intensity statins, with a consideration for high-intensity statins for those at higher cardiovascular risk. Prescribe either rosuvastatin (10 mg) or atorvastatin (20 mg), depending on the clinician's choice.
### Importance
The increased cardiovascular risk associated with type 2 diabetes. Statins are proven to reduce this risk of cardiovascular secondary to type 2 diabetes. Healthcare providers can better manage and reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in this high-risk population.
### Conclusion
Automation of the identification with tailored recommendations of eligible patients initiating statin therapy.
