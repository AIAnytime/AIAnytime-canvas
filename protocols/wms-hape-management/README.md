# High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) Protocol

This protocol provides guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) to ensure proper management and improve patient outcomes.

## Summary of Protocol

1. **Start Evaluation**: Initial assessment of the patient.
2. **Assess Risk Level**: Determine risk based on patient's history and rate of ascent.
3. **Symptoms of HAPE?**: Check for common symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion, cough, fatigue, and cyanosis.
4. **Diagnose HAPE**: Use clinical symptoms, pulse oximetry, and chest X-ray for diagnosis.
5. **Assess Severity of HAPE**: Determine if HAPE is mild or severe.
6. **Treatment for Mild HAPE**:
    - Monitor the patient.
    - Administer supplemental oxygen (SpO2 > 90%).
    - Use Nifedipine (30 mg every 12h or 20 mg every 8h).
    - Monitor improvement.
7. **Treatment for Severe HAPE**:
    - Immediate descent.
    - Administer supplemental oxygen (SpO2 > 90%).
    - Use Nifedipine (30 mg every 12h or 20 mg every 8h).
    - Consider using a portable hyperbaric chamber.
    - Monitor improvement.
8. **Monitor Improvement**: Check if the patient is improving.
    - If improving, proceed to recovery.
    - If not improving, further assessment is needed.
9. **Further Assessment Needed?**: Reevaluate the diagnosis if the patient is not improving.
10. **End**: Conclude the protocol if the patient is either recovering or further assessment is not required.

## Important Details and Considerations

- **Nifedipine**: A pulmonary vasodilator effective in preventing and treating HAPE. Typical dosage is 30 mg every 12 hours or 20 mg every 8 hours. It helps reduce pulmonary artery pressure.
- **Immediate Descent**: The most effective treatment for severe HAPE. Aim for at least a 1000-meter descent or until symptoms improve.
- **Supplemental Oxygen**: Used to maintain SpO2 above 90%. Effective in relieving symptoms and stabilizing the patient until descent or further treatment can be administered.
- **Portable Hyperbaric Chamber**: Can be used in severe cases where descent is not immediately possible. It simulates a lower altitude environment.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of treatment and the need for further intervention.
- **Further Assessment**: If the patient's condition does not improve, reassess for potential complications or alternative diagnoses.
