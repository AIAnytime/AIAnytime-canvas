- title: "Screening for Hepatitis B Virus Infection in Pregnant Women: US Preventive Services Task Force Reaffirmation Recommendation Statement"
  description: "This paper provides the US Preventive Services Task Force's (USPSTF) reaffirmation recommendation for hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit. It updates the 2009 recommendation, based on evidence review regarding the effectiveness and harms of screening for HBV infection and the effectiveness and harms of case management to prevent perinatal transmission. The paper concludes that screening for HBV in pregnant women provides substantial benefit."
