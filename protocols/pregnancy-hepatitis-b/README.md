The document provides a reaffirmation recommendation statement from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) regarding the screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in pregnant women. The key points from the protocol are summarized below:

### Purpose of the Protocol:
- To update the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on screening for HBV infection in pregnant women.
- The goal is to identify pregnant women who are infected with HBV to prevent perinatal transmission to their infants, which can lead to chronic infection and increased long-term morbidity and mortality due to liver complications.

### Studied Group:
- The studied group comprises pregnant women at their first prenatal visit.

### Recommended Actions:
- The USPSTF recommends screening for HBV infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit

### Rationale Behind the Recommendation:
- Screening for HBV during pregnancy is crucial for identifying women whose infants are at risk of perinatal transmission. Despite the guidelines for universal infant HBV vaccination, the rates of maternal HBV infection have shown an annual increase. Early detection through screening allows for appropriate interventions to prevent the transmission and manage the condition more effectively.

This protocol emphasizes the importance of early screening for HBV in pregnant women as a standard preventive service to safeguard infants' health by reducing the risk of transmission and subsequent chronic HBV infection.
