# Exercise-Induced Hyponatremia (EAH) Protocol

This protocol provides guidelines for the field treatment of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) to ensure proper management and improve patient outcomes.

## Summary of Protocol

1. **Symptomatic or collapse during or after exercise**: Initial assessment of the patient.
2. **Altered Mental Status?**: Determine if there is an altered mental status.
    - **YES**: Confusion, altered sensorium, vomiting, seizure, coma, ataxia, collapse, dyspnea.
    - **NO**: Weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps.
3. **Consider Alternative Diagnoses**: Evaluate for other possible conditions such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, altitude illness, infection, myocardial infarction, endocrine issues, toxin ingestion/drugs.

## Treatment Based on Diagnosis

### Severe EAH
- **Symptoms**: Large fluid intake, Dyspnea.
- **Treatment**: IV bolus 100 mL HTS, may repeat up to 3 doses every 10 minutes or until neurological symptoms subside.
- **Transport to Medical Care**.

### Heat Stroke
- **Symptoms**: Confirmed or suspected temperature > 40°C (104°F).
- **Treatment**: Aggressive immersion/conductive cooling, IV 1-2 L NS/D5NS (Consider IV HTS in case of progression to severe EAH).
- **Transport to Medical Care**.

### Mild EAH
- **Symptoms**: Bloated feeling, weight gain, normal vital signs, no orthostasis.
- **Treatment**: Fluid restrict until diuresis, salty snacks*, oral hypertonic solution*, monitor for progression to severe EAH.

### Heat Exhaustion/Dehydration
- **Symptoms**: Thirst, orthostatic symptoms, dry mucous membranes.
- **Treatment**: Drink to comfort‡, avoid forced fluids, rest in the shade, cold water dousing for cooling, monitor for progression to heat stroke.

## Important Details and Considerations

- **HTS (Hypertonic Saline)**: 3% sodium chloride.
- **NS (Normal Saline)**: 0.9% sodium chloride.
- **D5NS (5% Dextrose 0.9% Normal Saline)**.
- **IV (Intravenous)**: Used for administering fluids directly into the vein.

### Notes
- *If unable to tolerate by mouth due to nausea and vomiting, use antiemetic and/or IV HTS.
- ‡If unable to tolerate by mouth due to nausea and vomiting, and concerning for heat illness, use antiemetic and/or IV 1-2 L NS/D5NS (If IV isotonic fluids administered, consider IV HTS on standby in case of progression of mild to severe EAH).
