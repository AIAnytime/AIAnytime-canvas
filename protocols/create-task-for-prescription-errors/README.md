### Target Population
Patients with a failed prescription. When sending prescriptions via Surescripts, the status (whether it is accepted by the pharmacy) may not update immediately. This protocol notifies prescribers of errors so that they do not have to return to the patient's record to verify. 

### Effect
A task is generated when the prescription status changes to `error`

### Importance
Prescription errors can lead to adverse patient outcomes and complicate treatment plans. By automating the detection of such errors and creating tasks for follow-up, this protocol enhances patient safety and streamlines the process of addressing medication issues. This proactive approach helps to minimize potential medication-related problems and ensures that errors are caught and corrected in a timely manner.
