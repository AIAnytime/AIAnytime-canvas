# Summary of the Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically identify and manage side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, ensuring patient safety and effective medication use.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of patients currently on GLP-1 medications, such as liraglutide and semaglutide. It then narrows down to a subset of patients who have been on these medications for at least four weeks and have not undergone side effect screening in the past three months. Exclusion criteria are applied to ensure the focus is on patients who can benefit most from the screening. Diagnostic interventions include reviewing medical history, administering questionnaires, and conducting lab tests if necessary. The protocol concludes with conditions for successful screening, emphasizing documentation, patient communication, and follow-up plans.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population**: All patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and albiglutide.

- **Subset for Screening**: Patients on GLP-1 medications for at least four weeks and without a side effect screening in the last three months.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Documented allergies or contraindications to GLP-1 medications.
  - Discontinuation of GLP-1 medications within the last four weeks.
  - Participation in clinical trials with existing side effect monitoring.
  - Terminal illness or palliative care focus.

- **Diagnostic Interventions**:
  - Comprehensive review of medical history and symptoms.
  - Standardized questionnaire for common side effects like gastrointestinal issues, injection site reactions, pancreatitis, and thyroid tumors.
  - Laboratory tests, such as serum amylase and lipase, if symptoms suggest pancreatitis.

- **Conditions for Successful Screens**:
  - Documentation of any side effects experienced.
  - Clear communication and education on side effects and management.
  - Recommendations for healthcare provider consultation if significant side effects are identified.
  - Establishment of a follow-up plan, including potential medication adjustments or discontinuation.
