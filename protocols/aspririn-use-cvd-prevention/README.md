# Aspirin Use for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention
## Purpose of the Protocol
To update the recommendations on the use of low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults.

## Target Population
- Adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk who are not at increased risk for bleeding. Conditions such as not having a history of gastrointestinal ulcers, not having recent bleeding, not having other medical conditions that increase bleeding risk, and not taking medications that magnify bleeding risk should also be fulfilled.
- Adults aged 60 years or older are not recommended to start aspirin for primary CVD prevention.
## Recommendation
- For adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin should be individualized based on shared decision-making, focusing on the potential benefits and risks.
- Aspirin use for primary prevention is not recommended for adults aged 60 years and older due to insufficient net benefit in preventing CVD.
## Importance
- Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality, accounting for more than a quarter of all deaths. Early prevention through manageable interventions like aspirin can be significant for eligible individuals.
- Aspirin can reduce the risk of CVD events but also increases the risk for gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding, making careful patient selection critical.
## Conclusion
While aspirin can offer potential benefits in reducing the incidence of CVD events in certain adults aged 40 to 59 years at increased risk but not at increased risk for bleeding, it is not universally recommended for everyone in this age group or for those aged 60 and over due to the associated risks and unclear benefits. Decisions about aspirin use should therefore be tailored to individual risk profiles and discussed as part of a shared decision-making process.
