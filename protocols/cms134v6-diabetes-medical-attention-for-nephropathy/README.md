## Target Population
Patients aged 18 to 75 diagnosed with diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) who need nephropathy screening or have evidence of nephropathy. It excludes patients with secondary diabetes and those in hospice care during the measurement year.

## Recommendations
The protocol ensures that patients with diabetes receive a nephropathy screening test annually. If patients have a related diagnosis, active treatment, or relevant lab results, the protocol acknowledges their nephropathy status. Otherwise, clinicians are prompted to order a urine microalbumin test to assess kidney function.

## Importance
Diabetes is a leading cause of kidney failure, responsible for 44% of new cases in the U.S. in 2011. Early detection and management of nephropathy in diabetic patients are crucial for preventing severe complications like dialysis or kidney transplant. Regular screening for nephropathy is essential for slowing disease progression, reducing healthcare costs, and improving patient outcomes.

## Conclusion
This protocol streamlines diabetes care by integrating nephropathy screening recommendations into clinical workflows. It identifies patients needing nephropathy evaluation and prompts clinicians to order the appropriate tests, helping manage diabetes-related complications efficiently.
