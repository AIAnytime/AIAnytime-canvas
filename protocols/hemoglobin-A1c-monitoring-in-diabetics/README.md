### Target Population
Designed for patients with diabetes, focusing specifically on those whose condition may be complicated by either their age (80+) or other significant health issues. 

- Diabetic patients.
- Older adults (age 80+).
- Patients with chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic liver disease, cerebrovascular disease, advanced/terminal cancer, or chronic kidney disease stage 3 or onwards.

### Recommendations

Monitoring Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels based on the patient’s diabetes control and life expectancy:

- Controlled Diabetes: For patients whose diabetes is well-managed (A1c < 7 for standard patients or A1c < 8 for those with reduced life expectancy), A1c should be checked every 6 months.
- Uncontrolled Diabetes: For patients with poorly controlled diabetes (A1c ≥ 7 for standard patients or A1c ≥ 8 for those with reduced life expectancy), A1c should be checked every 3 months.
### Importance
A1c monitoring is critical for managing diabetes effectively and adjusting treatment plans to maintain optimal blood sugar levels. 
### Conclusion
Automates the process of determining the need for A1c testing based on a patient's diabetes control and other health factors. It evaluates whether recent A1c tests meet the recommended frequencies and generates actionable recommendations for clinicians when tests are due. By integrating this protocol, clinicians can streamline their workflow, ensure timely testing, and improve patient care by adhering to evidence-based guidelines for diabetes management.
