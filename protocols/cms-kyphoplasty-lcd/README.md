# Clinical Workflow for Determining Eligibility for Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation (PVA)

This clinical workflow helps determine if a patient meets the criteria for Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation (PVA) for Vertebral Compression Fracture (VCF). The decision-making process is based on patient symptoms, hospitalization status, pain severity, and response to non-surgical management. Follow the steps outlined to assess patient eligibility for Kyphoplasty/PVA.

## Workflow Summary

1. **Check if Osteoporotic Vertebral Fracture**
   - Determine if the patient has an osteoporotic vertebral fracture.

2. **Is the Patient Symptomatic?**
   - If the patient is symptomatic, proceed to check if the patient is hospitalized.
   - If the patient is not symptomatic, they are not eligible for the procedure.

3. **Is the Patient Hospitalized?**
   - If the patient is hospitalized, check if they have severe pain.
   - If the patient is not hospitalized, check if they have moderate to severe pain.

4. **Severe Pain (NRS/VAS ≥ 8)**
   - If the hospitalized patient has severe pain, proceed with the PVA procedure.

5. **Moderate to Severe Pain (NRS/VAS ≥ 5)**
   - If the non-hospitalized patient has moderate to severe pain, check if they have attempted non-surgical management (NSM).

6. **Attempted Non-Surgical Management (NSM)**
   - If NSM has been attempted, check for worsening pain or stable pain with additional criteria.
   - If NSM has not been attempted, the patient is not eligible for the procedure.

7. **Worsening Pain or Stable Pain with Additional Criteria**
   - If the patient has worsening pain or stable pain with additional criteria, proceed to check each criterion:
     - **> 25% Vertebral Body Height Reduction**
     - **Kyphotic Deformity**
     - **Severe Impact on Daily Functioning (RDQ > 17)**

8. **Proceed with Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation (PVA)**
   - If any of the criteria are met, proceed with the PVA procedure.

9. **Not Eligible for Procedure**
    - If none of the criteria are met, or if the patient is not symptomatic, not hospitalized with severe pain, or has not attempted NSM, they are not eligible for the procedure.

## Conclusion
This workflow helps determine the eligibility of patients for Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation based on their symptoms, hospitalization status, pain severity, and response to non-surgical management.
