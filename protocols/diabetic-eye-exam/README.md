### Target Population
Designed for patients aged 18-75 who have a diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. It specifically focuses on monitoring and managing these patients to ensure they receive timely retinal or dilated eye exams, pivotal for preventing diabetic retinopathy and related vision issues.
### Recommendations
  1. Perform Eye Exam: If a patient hasn't had a recent retinal or dilated eye exam, the protocol recommends performing the exam to ensure timely detection of any diabetic eye issues.
  2. Refer for Eye Exam: If the exam is overdue or not documented, the protocol advises referring the patient to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for the necessary examination.
### Importance
Diabetes significantly increases the risk of eye complications, including diabetic retinopathy, which can lead to vision loss if not monitored regularly. The protocol helps in managing this risk by ensuring patients receive appropriate eye care, thereby potentially reducing long-term complications and improving overall patient outcomes. 
### Conclusion
A systematic approach to tracking and managing eye exams for diabetic patients. By integrating with electronic health records, it automates the identification of patients who need eye exams and generates actionable recommendations for clinicians. This not only ensures adherence to best practices but also streamlines clinician workflows, improving efficiency in patient care and follow-up.
