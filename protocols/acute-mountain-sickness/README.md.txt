# Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) Protocol

This protocol provides guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) to ensure proper management and improve patient outcomes.

## Summary of Protocol

1. **Start Evaluation**: Initial assessment of the patient.
2. **Assess Risk Level**: Determine risk based on patient's history and rate of ascent.
3. **Symptoms of AMS?**: Check for common symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, and dizziness.
4. **Diagnose AMS**: Use the Lake Louise Score and clinical symptoms for diagnosis.
5. **Assess Severity of AMS**: Determine if AMS is mild or severe.
6. **Treatment for Mild AMS**:
    - Monitor the patient.
    - Rest and administer medications.
    - Use Acetazolamide (125-250 mg every 12h).
    - Consider Dexamethasone (4 mg every 6h).
    - Monitor improvement.
7. **Treatment for Severe AMS**:
    - Immediate descent.
    - Administer supplemental oxygen (SpO2 > 90%).
    - Administer Dexamethasone (4 mg every 6h).
    - Monitor improvement.
8. **Monitor Improvement**: Check if the patient is improving.
    - If improving, proceed to recovery.
    - If not improving, further assessment is needed.
9. **Further Assessment Needed?**: Reevaluate the diagnosis if the patient is not improving.
10. **End**: Conclude the protocol if the patient is either recovering or further assessment is not required.

## Important Details and Considerations

- **Acetazolamide**: Effective for both prevention and treatment of AMS. Typical dosage is 125-250 mg every 12 hours. It helps in acclimatization by promoting bicarbonate diuresis and respiratory stimulation.
- **Dexamethasone**: A potent steroid used when acetazolamide is contraindicated or for severe AMS. Dosage is typically 4 mg every 6 hours. It helps reduce inflammation and cerebral edema.
- **Immediate Descent**: The most effective treatment for severe AMS. Aim for at least a 1000-meter descent or until symptoms improve.
- **Supplemental Oxygen**: Used to maintain SpO2 above 90%. Effective in relieving symptoms and stabilizing the patient until descent or further treatment can be administered.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring is crucial to assess the effectiveness of treatment and the need for further intervention.
- **Further Assessment**: If the patient's condition does not improve, reassess for potential complications or alternative diagnoses.
