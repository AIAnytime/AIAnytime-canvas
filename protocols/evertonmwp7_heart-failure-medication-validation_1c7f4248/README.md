# Summary of Clinical Protocol for Validation of Heart Failure Medication Usage

The primary goal of this protocol is to ensure the appropriate use of heart failure medications in patients who may not have an active diagnosis of heart failure. It aims to validate the necessity of these medications through a structured screening and diagnostic process.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients with an active prescription for heart failure medication. From this group, a subset is considered for screeningâ€”specifically, those without an active heart failure diagnosis documented in their medical records. The protocol outlines exclusion criteria, such as patients with a history of heart failure in remission, those using the medication for off-label purposes with justification, and participants in clinical trials.

The diagnostic interventions involve a comprehensive review of the patient's medical history and current medications, a clinical assessment for heart failure symptoms, and necessary diagnostic tests like echocardiograms or BNP/NT-proBNP levels. Consultation with the prescribing physician is also recommended to discuss the rationale behind the medication use.

Key points to note include:
- **Initial Population:** All patients with an active prescription for heart failure medication.
- **Screening Subset:** Patients without an active heart failure diagnosis.
- **Exclusion Criteria:** Includes patients with inactive heart failure, off-label use with justification, and clinical trial participants.
- **Diagnostic Interventions:** Medical history review, clinical assessment, diagnostic tests, and physician consultation.
- **Successful Screen Conditions:** Confirmation of heart failure diagnosis, alternative diagnosis or justification for medication, or medication adjustment if unjustified.
- **Outcome:** Ensures appropriate medication use, with follow-up and monitoring if adjustments are made.
