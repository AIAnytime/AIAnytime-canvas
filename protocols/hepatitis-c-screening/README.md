# Hepatitis C Screening Protocol
## Purpose of the protocol
To provide updated guidelines for the screening of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults, aiming to reduce the prevalence and prevent complications associated with chronic hepatitis C infection.

## Target population
- Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 79 years: This protocol applies to all asymptomatic adults within this age range.
- Asymptomatic adults: Individuals without symptoms indicative of liver disease.
- Risk factors: Consideration for special populations, such as:
    - Pregnancy == true: Pregnant individuals should also be screened due to potential vertical transmission.
    - Injection Drug Use == past or present: Those with a history of or current injection drug use should be screened periodically.
    - Exposure Risk: High-risk populations, including those who have received blood transfusions before 1992, individuals with sexual partners infected with HCV, persons with HIV, and those born to HCV-infected mothers.
## Recommendation
- Screening:
    - One-time screening for all adults aged 18 to 79 years using anti-HCV antibody testing followed by confirmatory nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HCV RNA if positive.
    - Periodic screening for individuals with ongoing risk factors such as continued injection drug use or other repeated exposure risks.
    - Counseling and informed consent: Emphasize the voluntary nature of screening, the understanding of HCV infection transmission, and the meaning of test results.
## Importance
- Early detection: Facilitates early intervention, preventing progression to severe liver disease.
- Prevalence reduction: By identifying and treating asymptomatic individuals, it reduces the spread of HCV.
- Health outcomes improvement: Reduces the risks of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure through timely treatment.
- General health awareness: Increases patient awareness about HCV risks and management.

## Conclusion
The protocol emphasizes the substantial net benefit of screening for HCV infection in a wide population range from 18 to 79 years, extending beyond the previously recommended high-risk groups. The implementation of both one-time and periodic screenings based on risk factors, alongside patient education and voluntary testing, aims to significantly reduce the prevalence and health impacts of HCV.
