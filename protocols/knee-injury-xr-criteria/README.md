# Ottawa Knee Rules Protocol

## Summary

The Ottawa Knee Rules are a set of guidelines to help determine the need for X-ray imaging in patients with acute knee injuries. These rules are designed to identify fractures and reduce unnecessary radiography. The decision-making process involves assessing specific criteria related to patient age, tenderness, knee flexion, and weight-bearing ability.
