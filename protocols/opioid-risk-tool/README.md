# Opioid Risk Tool Protocol

## Summary

The Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) is a brief, self-report screening tool used to assess the risk of opioid abuse in individuals being considered for long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. The ORT evaluates various factors associated with the likelihood of opioid misuse and categorizes patients into low, moderate, and high risk based on their score.

## Patient Evaluation Using the ORT

1. **Patient Considered for Long-Term Opioid Therapy**

2. **Family History of Substance Abuse:**
    - **Alcohol:**
        - Male: 3 points
        - Female: 1 point
    - **Illegal drugs:**
        - Male: 3 points
        - Female: 2 points
    - **Prescription drugs:**
        - Male: 4 points
        - Female: 4 points

3. **Personal History of Substance Abuse:**
    - **Alcohol:**
        - Male: 3 points
        - Female: 3 points
    - **Illegal drugs:**
        - Male: 4 points
        - Female: 4 points
    - **Prescription drugs:**
        - Male: 5 points
        - Female: 5 points

4. **Age:**
    - Between 16-45 years: 1 point

5. **History of Preadolescent Sexual Abuse:**
    - Female: 3 points
    - Male: 0 points

6. **Psychological Disease:**
    - **ADD, OCD, Bipolar, Schizophrenia:** 2 points
    - **Depression:** 1 point

## Calculate ORT Score

- **Low Risk:** 0-3 points
- **Moderate Risk:** 4-7 points
- **High Risk:** 8 or more points

### Risk Categorization

- **Low Risk (0-3 points):** Patients in this category have a low likelihood of opioid abuse. Standard monitoring and prescribing practices can be followed.
- **Moderate Risk (4-7 points):** Patients in this category have a moderate risk of opioid abuse. Enhanced monitoring, use of opioid agreements, and consideration of alternative therapies are recommended.
- **High Risk (8 or more points):** Patients in this category have a high risk of opioid abuse. Intensive monitoring, strict opioid agreements, and alternative pain management strategies should be strongly considered.

This protocol helps healthcare providers in making informed decisions about opioid prescribing and implementing appropriate risk mitigation strategies.
