# Canadian best practice recommendations for the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: ventilation
**Developed by**: Canada ALS working group
**Description**:
Published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, this corresponds to the ventilation 
subsection of the ALS guidelines

# ALS Ventilation Guidelines

## Criteria for NIV Initiation

- Symptoms of respiratory insufficiency, including orthopnea
- SNIP ≤ 40 cm H2O or MIP ≤ 40 cm H2O
- Upright reliable† FVC < 65%
- FVC sitting or supine < 80% with symptoms or signs of respiratory insufficiency
- Daytime hypercapnia pCO2 > 45 mm Hg
- Abnormal nocturnal oximetry or symptomatic sleep-disordered breathing
- Consult respiratory specialist to initiate NIV

## Management

- **Initiate NIV** within 4 weeks
- Ensure in-home NIV respiratory support for education, titration, and troubleshooting
- Inform patients that NIV may change survival trajectory and end-of-life experience
- NIV enhances QOL in patients with respiratory insufficiency
- Ongoing assessments by specialized respiratory therapist, including device download and possibly nocturnal oximetry
- Oxygen not routine for chronic respiratory insufficiency; consider if hypoxemia remains after optimal NIV pressure
- Diaphragm pacing not recommended
- NIV recommended even if required 24 hours/day
- Consider mouthpiece ventilation during the day
- Invasive ventilation option if NIV ineffective
- ALS progression continues despite ventilatory support
- Discuss advanced care planning, goals of care, and all respiratory interventions
- Consider tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction with vocal cord paresis; discuss long-term invasive ventilation
