    description: "This protocol outlines the criteria and procedures for safely returning individuals to sports after a concussion. It includes initial population criteria, screening subsets, exclusion criteria, diagnostic interventions, and conditions for successful screening. The goal is to ensure athletes recover fully before resuming sports activities, with assessments on cognitive function, balance, and symptom monitoring, culminating in medical clearance for unrestricted participation."
