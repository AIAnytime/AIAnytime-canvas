### Target Population
Designed for use in healthcare settings where patients are involved in programs that can be disqualified based on their responses. ISuitable for patient populations undergoing assessments or interventions that might influence their program status. 
### Recommendations
When a patientâ€™s program status is updated to "disqualified," this protocol sends an automated notification to a specified webhook URL. It filters through patient interview responses to determine if the disqualification status should be communicated. If specific criteria in the responses are met, a notification is sent to alert relevant parties of the program disqualification.
### Importance
Ensures that any disqualification from a program is promptly communicated to necessary stakeholders through automated notifications. This helps in maintaining up-to-date information on patient status and ensuring timely adjustments or follow-ups. Automating this process reduces the risk of manual errors and delays in communication.
### Conclusion
Clinicians and program administrators can streamline the process of handling program disqualification statuses. It helps in efficient communication by automatically notifying relevant parties when a patient is disqualified from a program based on their responses. This leads to improved workflow efficiency, reducing the administrative burden on healthcare professionals and ensuring that program status changes are addressed promptly.
