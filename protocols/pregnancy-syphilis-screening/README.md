The document titled "Screening for Syphilis Infection in Pregnant Women" outlines a reaffirmed recommendation from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concerning the early screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women. This recommendation is categorized under an "A recommendation," emphasizing its importance based on the high certainty of substantial net benefit. The goal of this protocol is to reduce the incidence of congenital syphilis along with adverse outcomes associated with maternal infection, responding to the rising cases of congenital syphilis noted in recent years.

### Purpose of the Protocol:
- **To reaffirm the 2009 USPSTF recommendation** on syphilis screening in pregnant women due to the known benefits of early detection and treatment in preventing congenital syphilis morbidity and mortality.
- **To address the public health concern** emerging from the notable increase in congenital syphilis rates from 2012 to 2016, paralleled by an increase in syphilis among women of reproductive age.

### Studied Group:
- **All pregnant women** are the target group for this screening protocol, regardless of the stage of pregnancy, to prevent the transmission of syphilis from mother to child.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Early universal screening** for syphilis infection in all pregnant women, utilizing accurate screening algorithms to detect syphilis infection early.
- **Treatment with antibiotics** if infection is detected, to prevent congenital syphilis and significantly decrease adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Rationale and Findings:
- **Benefits:** Convincing evidence exists that early screening and subsequent treatment of syphilis infection in pregnant women can substantially reduce the risk of congenital syphilis and associated adverse pregnancy outcomes.
- **Harms:** Potential harms from screening are considered to be small and may include false-positive results leading to further clinical evaluation, anxiety, and the harms associated with antibiotic treatment. However, these are outweighed by the benefits of screening.

### Conclusion:
The USPSTF recommends early screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women as a critical intervention to protect maternal and child health, reinforcing the recommendation with a high level of certainty in its substantial benefits. This protocol serves not only as a preventive measure but also as a direct response to the observed increase in syphilis rates among pregnant women and the associated rise in congenital syphilis cases.
