The provided document outlines a medical protocol developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for screening for depression and assessing suicide risk in adults, with a specific emphasis on identifying those at risk and recommending appropriate actions. Here is the summary of the protocol:

**Purpose of the Protocol:**
The protocol aims to address the need for systematic screening for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and to evaluate the risk of suicide in asymptomatic adults. This is due to the substantial impact untreated MDD can have on individuals' lives, including daily functioning interference, increased risk of cardiovascular events, exacerbation of comorbid conditions, and heightened mortality rates. The USPSTF highlights the importance of identifying MDD due to its potential for chronicity, characterized by periods of remission and recurrence, often beginning in adolescence or early adulthood.

**Studied Group:**
The target population for this protocol includes asymptomatic adults aged 19 years or older, encompassing pregnant and postpartum persons. Older adults are specifically defined as those aged 65 years or older. The protocol directs attention to asymptomatic individuals who do not have a diagnosed mental health disorder or recognizable signs or symptoms of depression or suicide risk.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Screening for Depression in Adults:** The USPSTF recommends screening for depression in the adult population, covering pregnant and postpartum individuals as well as older adults, assigning this a "B" grade recommendation. This recommendation is based on moderate certainty that such screening delivers a moderate net benefit. Screening aims to facilitate further evaluation for individuals testing positive, thereby guiding them toward appropriate, evidence-based care to mitigate the morbidity associated with depression.

2. **Assessment of Suicide Risk:** Despite the high stakes of suicide risk, the USPSTF concludes with an "I" statement on screening for said risk, indicating that current evidence is insufficient to ascertain the balance of benefits and harms of such screening practices in adults. This reflects the need for more comprehensive research and data to support concrete recommendations in this area.

The USPSTF emphasizes the critical pathway to benefit from depression screening, stressing the importance of adequate follow-up diagnostic evaluations and the provision or referral to evidence-based care for those who screen positive. This approach is designed to improve health outcomes by reducing disparities in the morbidity associated with depression.

Overall, the protocol underscores a crucial public health strategy aimed at early identification and intervention for individuals with MDD, while also acknowledging the current limitations in evidence surrounding suicide risk assessment within the adult population.
