# Summary of the Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically identify and manage side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, ensuring patient safety and optimal medication use.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of all patients currently on GLP-1 medications, such as liraglutide and semaglutide. It then narrows down to a subset of patients who have been on these medications for at least four weeks and have not had a side effect screening in the past three months. Exclusion criteria are applied to ensure the focus is on patients who can benefit most from the screening. Diagnostic interventions include a comprehensive review of medical history, a standardized questionnaire, and necessary laboratory tests. The protocol concludes with conditions for successful screening, emphasizing documentation, communication, and follow-up plans.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population**: Includes all patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists like liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and albiglutide.

- **Subset for Screening**: 
  - Patients on GLP-1 medications for at least four weeks.
  - Patients without a documented side effect screening in the last three months.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Documented allergies or contraindications to GLP-1 medications.
  - Discontinued GLP-1 medications within the last four weeks.
  - Participation in clinical trials with regular side effect monitoring.
  - Terminal illness or palliative care patients.

- **Diagnostic Interventions**:
  - Comprehensive review of medical history and symptoms.
  - Standardized questionnaire for common side effects like gastrointestinal issues and pancreatitis signs.
  - Laboratory tests, such as serum amylase and lipase, if pancreatitis is suspected.

- **Conditions for Successful Screens**:
  - Documentation of any side effects.
  - Clear communication and education on side effects and management.
  - Recommendation for healthcare provider consultation if significant side effects are found.
  - Follow-up plans for patients with side effects, including possible medication adjustments.
