### Target Population
Patients with diabetes who are on insulin, sulfonylureas, or glinides. Specifically, it targets those who experience frequent hypoglycemic episodes (defined as blood glucose levels <70 mg/dL) or who have impaired cognitive function.
### Recommendations
Prescribing glucagon and providing instructions for its use. This recommendation is made for patients who have diabetes and are on one of the specified medications, particularly if they have two or more hypoglycemic episodes per week or exhibit impaired cognitive function. Glucagon is intended to quickly raise blood glucose levels in the event of a hypoglycemic emergency.
### Importance
Managing hypoglycemia effectively is crucial for patients with diabetes, especially those on insulin or certain oral medications. Frequent hypoglycemic events can be dangerous and lead to severe complications, including cognitive impairment. By ensuring that patients have glucagon available, this protocol aims to reduce the risk of severe hypoglycemia and improve patient safety.
### Conclusion
Clinicians can assess the need for glucagon prescriptions by evaluating a patient's medication regimen and history of hypoglycemic episodes. This approach optimizes the prevention of severe hypoglycemia, enhancing overall diabetes management.
