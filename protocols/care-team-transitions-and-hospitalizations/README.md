### Target Population
This protocol is designed for patients who have an open transition task but have not yet undergone their annual assessment. Transition tasks could involve significant care changes or follow-ups post-discharge that require monitoring. This measure ensures that patients in this category receive timely follow-up and assessment.
### Recommendations
1.) Review Transition Tasks: The protocol identifies patients with open transition tasks who have not had their annual assessment.
2.) Perform Follow-Up Calls: Ensure these patients are contacted and assessed, particularly if a phone call has not been made on the current day.
Schedule Reassessment: If a patient with an open transition task has not been called today, schedule a follow-up call for the next day.
### Importance
Implementing this protocol helps in maintaining continuity of care and ensuring that patients with critical transition needs are not missed. It supports timely follow-ups, which can prevent gaps in care and enhance patient outcomes. By ensuring that these patients are contacted and assessed regularly, clinicians can better manage transitions and prevent potential readmissions or other adverse events.
### Conclusion
This Python-based protocol automates the tracking and management of patients with transition tasks who lack an annual assessment. It streamlines the process of identifying these patients and ensures they are followed up in a timely manner. This can lead to improved patient care, better management of transition tasks, and a more efficient clinician workflow by reducing manual tracking and follow-up efforts.
