"Cancer Pain Management in Adults" is an evidence-based clinical practice guideline adapted for use in Australia. Developed under the editorial lead of Akari Suzuki at the Cancer Council Australia, this guideline aims to provide recommendations for the screening, assessment, and management of cancer-related pain in adults. It emphasizes chronic pain management over acute pain that occurs as a result of cancer treatments or pain in cancer survivors, recommending both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management alongside patient awareness and self-management

**Purpose of the Protocol:**
The protocol is intended for Australian health professionals of all disciplines caring for people with cancer. While these recommendations don't intend to replace expert clinical judgment, they aim to guide non-specialists in providing essential care. The significance of this guideline stems from the finding that 30–75% of cancer patients experience pain, which is often under-treated due to various barriers at patient, caregiver, health professional, and systemic levels

**Studied Group:**
The recommendations are specifically tailored for adults experiencing cancer-related chronic pain. It targets patients newly referred who report a pain score of 2 or more or exhibit pain-related behaviors or discomfort, particularly if there's a report of new pain or a sudden, unexpected intensification of pain

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Person-centred Care:**
   - Establish a multidisciplinary team approach tailored to the patient's pain management needs and preferences.
   - Adopt a person-centered approach, taking into account individual needs and involving patients in developing treatment plans

2. **Screening and Assessment:**
   - Conduct thorough pain intensity assessments using self-reported scales and observe pain-related behaviors, particularly in patients with cognitive impairments. Comprehensive assessments should include the evaluation of disease status, pain severity, and experience, among other factors

3. **Pharmacological Management:**
   - Start with WHO-recommended analgesics appropriate for the pain severity, using NSAIDs, paracetamol, and opioids as initial options. 
   - Consider opioids for moderate to severe pain or unrelieved pain by other treatments, with specific guidance for starting doses and titration based on patient characteristics including renal and hepatic function

   - Explore alternative routes like transdermal administration for stable pain, and adjust or switch opioids based on effectiveness and adverse effects, such as renal impairment or constipation management

4. **Non-pharmacological Management:**
   - Suggest consultations with physiotherapists for potential suitability of non-pharmacological pain management strategies.
   - Provide support for psychosocial and spiritual concerns and consider referral to occupational therapists, clinical psychologists for various therapies, and discussions on complementary therapies

This comprehensive guide emphasizes the integration of patient-centered care, thorough assessment, and both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for effective cancer pain management.
