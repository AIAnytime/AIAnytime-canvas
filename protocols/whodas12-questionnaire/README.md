## Appropriate Patient Populations

The Brief WHODAS-12 questionnaire is designed to assess various aspects of a patient's health and functional ability. It is suitable for a broad spectrum of patient populations, particularly those with chronic illnesses, mobility issues, and mental health conditions. This questionnaire is especially useful for older adults who may suffer from a range of impairments due to aging. Additionally, it is applicable to patients undergoing rehabilitation after surgery or a severe illness, as it evaluates how well they can perform daily activities and participate in community life. By assessing multiple functional domains, the questionnaire provides comprehensive insights into how a patient's health condition affects their everyday life.

## Diagnostic and Treatment Applications

The Brief WHODAS-12 questionnaire serves dual roles in both diagnostic and treatment settings. Diagnostically, it helps healthcare providers identify specific areas of difficulty that patients encounter in their daily lives, such as standing, taking care of household responsibilities, and emotional well-being. These insights allow clinicians to make more accurate diagnoses concerning patients' physical and mental health statuses. From a treatment perspective, the questionnaire results can inform personalized treatment and intervention plans. For instance, if a patient shows severe difficulty in walking long distances, physical therapy might be recommended. Similarly, emotional difficulties uncovered by the questionnaire could lead to a referral to mental health services. The survey's insights enable holistic and targeted care plans that address both medical and functional needs.

## Authorship and Validation

The Brief WHODAS-12 is derived from the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), created by the World Health Organization (WHO). It has been widely validated and is backed by extensive research, making it a reliable tool for assessing disability in various populations. The WHODAS is based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), which provides a standardized framework for measuring health and disability. This rigor ensures that the questionnaire is not only scientifically sound but also highly applicable across different cultural and clinical settings. By leveraging a well-validated tool like the WHODAS-12, healthcare providers can trust in the reliability and accuracy of the data collected, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
