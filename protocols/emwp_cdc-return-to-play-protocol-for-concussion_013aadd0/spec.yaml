  - title: "CDC's Concussion Return-to-Play Protocol for Athletes"
    description: "This protocol outlines the CDC's guidelines for safely returning athletes to sports after a concussion. It includes criteria for initial population, screening subsets, exclusion criteria, diagnostic interventions, and conditions for successful screening. The goal is to ensure athletes are symptom-free, have returned to baseline cognitive function, and can complete a graduated return-to-play protocol before receiving final clearance from a healthcare professional. This approach minimizes the risk of further injury and supports long-term neurological health."
