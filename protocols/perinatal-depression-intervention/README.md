# Intervention to Prevent Perinatal Depression
## Purpose of the protocol
To update the 2016 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on interventions to prevent perinatal depression in pregnant and postpartum persons at increased risk.

## Target population
- if pregnant or postpartum (within 1 year after delivery)
- if increased risk factors are present such as:
- if history of depression
- if current depressive symptoms
- if certain socioeconomic risk factors (e.g., low socioeconomic status, single parenthood)

## Recommendation
The USPSTF recommends that clinicians provide or refer pregnant and postpartum persons who are at increased risk of perinatal depression to counseling interventions.

## Importance
- Prevalence: Perinatal depression affects around 10% to 20% of women during pregnancy or after childbirth.
- Health Risks: Perinatal depression is associated with poor maternal health, as well as adverse effects on the infant, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and developmental issues.
- Treatment Efficacy: Counseling interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) have been shown to be effective in preventing perinatal depression among those at increased risk.

## Conclusion
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that providing or referring pregnant and postpartum persons at increased risk of perinatal depression to counseling interventions has a moderate net benefit in improving maternal and infant health outcomes. The harms of these interventions are minimal.
