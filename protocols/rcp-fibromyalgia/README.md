# Fibromyalgia Diagnosis Guidelines

**Developed by**: Royal College of Physicians (UK)

**Description**:
This guideline is a subset of the comprehensive RCP guideline for fibromyalgia syndrome. It outlines when to refer someone for specialty services

## Referral Not Required
- When FMS symptoms and signs are unequivocal.

## Referral Required
Referral to a specialist service is appropriate in the following cases:
- Continually equivocal FMS symptoms.
- Clear diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., inflammatory rheumatological or neurological symptoms).
- Presence of complex multiple health conditions.
- Symptoms that need investigating but are outside the clinicianâ€™s scope of practice.

## Referral Options
- **Rheumatology or Pain Medicine Services**: For confirmation of FMS diagnosis or exclusion of other diagnoses.
- **Neurology Services**: For exclusion of neurological diseases.

*Note: Availability of services and pathways vary within the UK.*
