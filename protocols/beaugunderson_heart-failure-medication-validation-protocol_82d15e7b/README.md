# Summary of Clinical Protocol for Validation of Heart Failure Medication Usage

The end goal of this protocol is to ensure that heart failure medications are appropriately prescribed and used within the healthcare system. It aims to validate the necessity of these medications for patients, confirming either a heart failure diagnosis or an alternative rationale for their use.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients with an active prescription for heart failure medication. From this group, a subset is considered for screening: those who do not have an active diagnosis of heart failure in their medical records. The protocol then applies exclusion criteria to filter out patients who have documented reasons for taking the medication other than heart failure, such as hypertension, or those undergoing evaluation for heart failure.

Diagnostic interventions are conducted to assess the necessity of the medication. This involves reviewing the patient's medical history and medication list, consulting with the prescribing healthcare provider, and, if necessary, scheduling diagnostic tests like echocardiograms or BNP tests. The conditions for successful screens include confirming a heart failure diagnosis or documenting an alternative rationale for the medication. If neither is confirmed, a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist or primary care provider is recommended.
