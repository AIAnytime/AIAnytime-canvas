## Target Population
The `HyperlinkRecommendation` protocol is designed for all patients who have completed a COVID-19 questionnaire between 5 and 7 days ago. This target population includes patients who have recently engaged with a COVID-19 assessment tool but may require follow-up actions.

## Recommendations
The protocol generates recommendations for follow-up actions based on the timing of the COVID-19 questionnaire completion. Specifically:
 
 - It provides a hyperlink recommendation for additional resources or actions.
 - It suggests administering an influenza vaccine to the patient, which is indicated as part of routine health maintenance.
## Importance
This protocol is crucial for ensuring timely follow-up and management of patients who have recently completed a COVID-19 questionnaire. By acting within a specific timeframe, it helps in addressing any emerging needs or additional actions that may be required, such as preventive measures or further patient engagement.

## Conclusion
The `HyperlinkRecommendation` protocol automates the process of recommending follow-up actions based on recent COVID-19 questionnaire completions. It integrates seamlessly into the clinician's workflow by providing timely recommendations for both further actions and preventive care, such as immunizations. This automation helps streamline clinical workflows, ensuring that follow-up steps are not overlooked and that patients receive appropriate care in a timely manner.
