    description: "This protocol outlines the CDC's guidelines for safely returning athletes to sports after a concussion. It includes criteria for screening, exclusion, and diagnostic interventions such as neurocognitive and balance assessments. Successful recovery is marked by a return to baseline cognitive and physical function, absence of symptoms, and completion of a stepwise return-to-play process. Final clearance is given by a healthcare professional to ensure athlete safety."
