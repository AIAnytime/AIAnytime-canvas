# Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Treatment Protocol

This protocol outlines the treatment of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) with a focus on patient-specific factors such as comorbidities, recent antibiotic use, age, smoking status, and allergies. The treatment options vary based on these factors to ensure optimal and individualized patient care.

## Summary of the Protocol

1. **Diagnosis:**
   - Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Diagnosis

2. **Assess for Comorbidities:**
   - Check for any of the following:
     - Comorbidities
     - Recent antibiotic use
     - Age ≥ 65
     - Smoking

3. **If No Comorbidities:**
   - **Penicillin Allergy/Intolerance?**
     - **Yes:**
       - **Cephalosporin Allergy?**
         - **Yes:** Use Fluoroquinolone, Lefamulin, or Omadacycline
         - **No:** Use 3rd Gen Cephalosporin + Macrolide or + Doxycycline
     - **No:** Use Amoxicillin + Macrolide or + Doxycycline

4. **If Comorbidities Present:**
   - **Penicillin Allergy/Intolerance?**
     - **Yes:**
       - **Cephalosporin Allergy?**
         - **Yes:** Assess for Structural Lung Disease
           - **Yes:** Use Respiratory Fluoroquinolone (e.g., Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin)
           - **No:** Use Fluoroquinolone, Lefamulin, or Omadacycline
         - **No:** Use 3rd Gen Cephalosporin + Macrolide or + Doxycycline
     - **No:** Use Amoxicillin-Clavulanate + Macrolide or + Doxycycline

## Protocol Caveats

- **Allergies:**
  - The protocol varies significantly based on the patient's allergies to Penicillin and Cephalosporin.
  
- **Comorbidities:**
  - Presence of comorbidities or factors such as recent antibiotic use, age ≥ 65, and smoking status influence the choice of antibiotics.
  
- **Structural Lung Disease:**
  - Patients with structural lung disease have a distinct treatment pathway to ensure effective management of CAP.

- **Lefamulin and Omadacycline**
  - Lefamulin is a newer agent that is active against most CAP pathogens including S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, and atypical pathogens. Although lefamulin lacks activity against Enterobacteriaceae (eg, Klebsiella spp and E. coli) and thus is not appropriate for patients with structural lung disease, its more targeted spectrum makes it less disruptive to the microbiome. Clinical experience with lefamulin is limited, and it is not recommended in moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction, pregnancy, breastfeeding, known long QT syndrome, or with concomitant QT-prolonging agents. There are drug interactions with CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers and substrates; in addition, lefamulin tablets are contraindicated with QT-prolonging CYP3A4 substrates. 
    
  - Omadacycline is another newer agent that is active against most CAP pathogens, including Enterobacteriaceae. It is a potential alternative for patients who cannot tolerate beta-lactams (or other agents) and want to avoid fluoroquinolones.
