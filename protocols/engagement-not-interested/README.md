### Target Population
Designed for patients who have previously indicated they are "not interested" in engaging with their healthcare provider. Forcusing on monitoring patient interactions, particularly those who have not had recent annual assessments or have specific task labels related to engagement or transition.
### Recommendations
- #### For Patients in Denominator 1: 
  If a patient is marked as "not interested," has not had an annual assessment this year, and lacks any engagement or transition tasks, the protocol recommends contacting the patient to reassess their interest.
- #### For Patients in Denominator 2:
  If a patient is marked as "not interested" but has had an annual assessment this year, the protocol evaluates if recent interactions should be reviewed or additional follow-up is necessary.
### Importance
Ensures patients who have previously shown disinterest are not overlooked. Aiming to re-engage patients who might be interested now, particularly if they haven't been assessed recently or if there's no ongoing engagement task. 
### Conclusion
Automating the evaluation of patient interactions and statuses, helps clinicians manage their outreach more effectively. Providing a structured approach to identify and act on patients who might need follow-up, improving the overall quality of patient engagement and care continuity.
