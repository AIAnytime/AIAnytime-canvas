### Summary
The protocol checks if a patient has active insurance coverage. If a patient lacks active coverage, a banner alert will be displayed in their electronic health record (EHR) summary and profile, notifying the healthcare provider. This automated alert system ensures that clinicians are immediately aware of any gaps in coverage, allowing them to address potential issues before they affect patient care.

### Importance
Active insurance coverage is crucial for ensuring that patients receive timely and appropriate care. By automating the process of checking insurance status, this protocol reduces the risk of missed care opportunities due to inactive or lapsed coverage. This not only improves the efficiency of clinical workflows but also helps maintain continuous care for patients, particularly those with chronic conditions.

### Conclusion
The Active Coverage Check protocol enhances clinical workflows by automating the verification of insurance coverage and providing real-time alerts to clinicians. This ensures that patients receive uninterrupted care and that healthcare providers can proactively manage potential coverage issues, leading to better overall patient outcomes.
