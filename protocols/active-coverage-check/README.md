### Effect
If an eligibility request returns an inactive response, this protocol displays a banner alert in the chart summary and profile to make the care team aware. Eligibility checks are automated in Canvas when coverage is added or leading up to a scheduled appointment. They can also be triggered through the FHIR API.

### Importance
Active insurance coverage is crucial for ensuring that patients receive timely and appropriate care. By automating the process of checking insurance status, this protocol reduces the risk of missed care opportunities due to inactive or lapsed coverage. This not only improves the efficiency of clinical workflows but also helps maintain continuous care for patients, particularly those with chronic conditions.
