### Recommendations

**A. Secondary Prevention for Minor Ischaemic Stroke or TIA:**
- **Lifestyle Modifications:** Address smoking, alcohol, diet, and exercise.
- **Medications:**
  - Antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.
  - High-intensity statin therapy.
  - Blood pressure-lowering therapy (thiazide-like diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors).

**B. Antiplatelet Therapy:**
- **Dual Therapy (within 24 hours, low bleeding risk):**
  - **Option 1:** Clopidogrel + Aspirin for 21 days, then clopidogrel alone.
  - **Option 2:** Ticagrelor + Aspirin for 30 days, then ticagrelor or clopidogrel alone.
- **Single Therapy:** Clopidogrel if dual therapy is unsuitable.
- Consider a proton pump inhibitor to reduce gastrointestinal bleeding risk.
- Check for clopidogrel resistance in recurrent cases.

**C. Statin Therapy:**
- Start high-intensity statin therapy immediately (e.g., atorvastatin 20-80 mg daily).

**D. Anticoagulation in Atrial Fibrillation:**
- Anticoagulate after excluding intracranial bleeding if no contraindications.

**E. Carotid Imaging:**
- Perform within 24 hours for candidates of carotid intervention using ultrasound, CT angiography, or MR angiography.

**F. Reporting Carotid Stenosis:**
- Use the NASCET method.

**G. Severe Carotid Stenosis (50-99% NASCET):**
- Refer for endarterectomy within 7 days of symptoms.
- Provide optimal medical treatment (blood pressure control, antiplatelet therapy, cholesterol management, lifestyle advice).

**H. Mild/Moderate Carotid Stenosis (<50% NASCET):**
- No carotid intervention.
- Provide optimal medical treatment (as above).

**I. Alternative Diagnosis:**
- Reassess patients with recurrent symptoms despite treatment and no embolic source.

**J. Carotid Angioplasty/Stenting:**
- Consider for patients unsuitable for open surgery.

**K. Postoperative Review:**
- Review patients post-carotid revascularisation to optimise secondary prevention.
