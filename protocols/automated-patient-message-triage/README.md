### Target Population
This protocol is designed for any healthcare system where patients can send messages directly to their care team. It is particularly suitable for environments where timely responses to patient messages are crucial, such as urgent care centers or primary care practices managing a high volume of patient communications.
### Recommendations
- Integration: Integrate this protocol into patient messaging systems to automatically triage incoming messages based on their content.
- Endpoint Configuration: Configure the `ENDPOINT_URL` and `ENDPOINT_HEADERS` to connect with third-party services that can process patient messages and determine urgency.
- Response Handling: Customize the `process_endpoint_response` method to match the specific keywords or criteria relevant to your practice for determining message urgency.
### Importance
The protocol automates the triage of patient messages, potentially improving response times and prioritizing urgent issues. By leveraging automation, it ensures that critical patient communications are promptly addressed, which can enhance patient satisfaction and reduce the risk of overlooking urgent messages.
### Conclusion
This Python-based protocol integrates patient messaging with external processing systems, automatically creating tasks for urgent messages and sending acknowledgment replies when appropriate. By streamlining message triage and response, it enhances clinician workflow efficiency and ensures that important patient communications are handled promptly. This automation supports better resource management and can lead to improved patient care outcomes.
