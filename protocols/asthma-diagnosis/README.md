## Target Population
Asthmatic patients or individuals at risk for asthma.

## Recommendations
Clinicians should use this protocol to streamline the process of identifying patients with asthma during health maintenance checkups. If a patient has been diagnosed with asthma, the protocol provides a prompt to contact the patient, which could include scheduling follow-up care or managing treatment plans. The automated alert system ensures clinicians are notified when a diagnosis has been made and helps prioritize patient outreach.

## Importance
Helps to streamline the process of identifying patients with asthma during routine health checkups. If a patient has asthma, it sends a prompt to contact them, which may involve scheduling follow-up appointments or updating their care plan. The system automatically alerts staff when a diagnosis is found, making it easier to prioritize patient outreach.

## Conclusion
This protocol simplifies asthma patient management by automatically flagging individuals with a recorded diagnosis and prompting appropriate actions. Its integration into clinician workflows improves patient care by supporting timely communication and follow-up, leading to better chronic disease management and optimized use of clinical resources.
