# Insulin Initiation and Titration Protocol

This protocol outlines the clinical workflow for initiating and titrating insulin in diabetic patients to achieve and maintain target blood glucose levels and HbA1c.

## Summary of Protocol

1. **Initiate Insulin**
   - Start with bedtime intermediate-acting insulin or bedtime or morning long-acting insulin.
   - Initial dose: 10 units or 0.2 units per kg.

2. **Check Fasting Glucose**
   - Perform daily fingerstick glucose checks.
   - Increase dose typically by 2 units every 3 days until fasting levels are in the target range (80-130 mg/dL or 4.4-7.2 mmol/L).
   - Can increase dose in larger increments, e.g., by 4 units every 3 days, if fasting glucose >180 mg/dL (>10 mmol/L).

3. **Manage Hypoglycemia**
   - If hypoglycemia occurs or fasting glucose level <80 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L), reduce bedtime dose by 4 units or 10%, whichever is greater.

4. **Evaluate HbA1c after 2-3 Months**
   - Check if HbA1c is ≥7%.
   - **If No**: Continue regimen; check HbA1c every 3 months.
   - **If Yes**: Proceed to check glucose range throughout the day.

5. **Check Glucose Throughout the Day**
   - If fasting glucose is in the target range (80-130 mg/dL or 4.4-7.2 mmol/L), check glucose pre-lunch, pre-dinner, and pre-bed.
   - Depending on glucose results, add a second injection.
   - Typically begin with approximately 4 units and adjust by 2 units every 3 days until glucose is in the range.

6. **Adjust Insulin Based on Glucose Levels**
   - **Pre-lunch glucose out of range**: Add rapid-acting insulin at breakfast.
   - **Pre-dinner glucose out of range**: Add NPH insulin at breakfast or rapid-acting at lunch.
   - **Pre-bed glucose out of range**: Add rapid-acting insulin at dinner.

7. **Evaluate HbA1c after 3 Months**
   - Check if HbA1c is ≥7%.
   - **If No**: Continue regimen; check HbA1c every 3 months.
   - **If Yes**: Recheck pre-meal glucose levels and if out of range, may need to add another injection; if HbA1c continues to be out of range, check 2-hour postprandial levels and adjust preprandial rapid-acting insulin.

## Important Details and Considerations

- **Initial Insulin Dosage**: Start with 10 units or 0.2 units per kg of bedtime intermediate-acting insulin or long-acting insulin.
- **Dose Adjustments**: Typically increase by 2 units every 3 days until target fasting glucose levels are achieved. Larger increments (e.g., 4 units every 3 days) may be used if fasting glucose levels are significantly high (>180 mg/dL).
- **Hypoglycemia Management**: Reduce bedtime insulin dose by 4 units or 10% (whichever is greater) if fasting glucose levels drop below 80 mg/dL or hypoglycemia occurs.
- **HbA1c Targets**: Aim for HbA1c <7% within 2-3 months. If targets are not met, assess and adjust insulin regimen.
- **Adding Second Injection**: Based on pre-lunch, pre-dinner, and pre-bed glucose levels, additional insulin injections may be necessary.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and periodic evaluation of glucose levels and HbA1c are crucial for effective insulin titration and achieving glycemic control.
