## Target Population
Patients who show signs of chronic kidney disease (CKD) without a formally diagnosed. Individuals with two or more elevated creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values below 60 ml/min in the last two years and no active CKD-related condition.
## Recommendations
Clinicians consider updating the patient's `Conditions List` to include CKD-related diagnoses when appropriate. If tha patient fitting the criteria of two or more eGFR values < 60 ml/min and no active CKD diagnosis, it will flag the patient as "Due" for a review.
## Importance
Identifying patients with undiagnosed CKD is crucial as early detection and treatment can significantly slow disease progression, reduce complications, and improve patient outcomes. 
## Conclusion
Implementing this protocol in clinical settings ensures potential CKD patients are not overlooked.
