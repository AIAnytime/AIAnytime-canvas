### Target Population
Designed for patients who have recently been prescribed a new medication from the SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) or SNRI (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors) classes with no prior history.

### Recommendations

1. Webhook Notification: When a new SSRI or SNRI prescription is made, a webhook is sent to the patient portal with information about these medications.
2. Task Creation: A task is generated for the care coordination team to follow up with the patient in 2 weeks to assess medication tolerability.
3. Follow-Up Appointment: A recommendation is made for the patient to schedule a follow-up visit in 4 weeks.

### Importance
Ensures that patients starting on new SSRI or SNRI medications receive timely follow-up care. Crucial for monitoring how well the patients tolerate the medication and to address any potential side effects. 
### Conclusion
Integrates automated tasks and notifications into the patient management workflow. By generating follow-up tasks with direct patient notifications, enhancing care coordination and appropriate monitoring when starting a new SSRI or SNRI.
