### Target Population
This protocol is designed for patients participating in a weight loss program who are in the "Condition screening" status. This status is captured using the `Weight Loss Program Status Questionnaire`.

### Recommendations
The following tests are recommmended if they have not been performed within the last year: 
- **Hemoglobin A1c (Hba1C):** To screen for diabetes.
- **Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH):** To check for hypothyroidism.
- **Urine Cortisol:** To assess for Cushing's syndrome.

### Importance
Identifying these conditions early is crucial as they can significantly impact a patientâ€™s weight loss efforts and overall health. Diabetes, hypothyroidism, and Cushing's syndrome can contribute to weight gain or hinder weight loss, making it essential to address these issues promptly for effective treatment.

### Conclusion
This protocol ensures that patients in the weight loss program are appropriately screened for diabetes, hypothyroidism, and Cushing's syndrome. By automating the screening process, it helps maintain up-to-date records, facilitates timely interventions, and supports better patient outcomes. Clinicians are alerted when tests are needed and can act on these recommendations to provide comprehensive care.
