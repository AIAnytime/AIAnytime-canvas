# Screening for Gestational Diabetes
## Purpose of the protocol
To provide recommendations for screening asymptomatic pregnant persons for gestational diabetes to improve maternal and fetal outcomes.

## Target population
Pregnant persons who have not been previously diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
Gestational age >= 24 weeks of gestation.
Asymptomatic pregnant persons.
If gestational age < 24 weeks of gestation, evidence is insufficient to determine benefits vs. harms of screening.

## Recommendation
- Screen for gestational diabetes in asymptomatic pregnant persons at 24 weeks of gestation or later.
- Implement screening using one of several methods, such as:
    - A 2-step process: Initial screening with an oral glucose challenge test (OGCT), followed by a diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) if initially screened positive.
    - A 1-step process: Administer an OGTT to all patients.
    - Fasting plasma glucose measurement.
## Importance
- Maternal and fetal complications due to undetected gestational diabetes:
    - Increased risk of type 2 diabetes post-pregnancy
    - Maternal risks such as preeclampsia, hypertension
    - Fetal risks such as macrosomia, birth injuries, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions
- Improves maternal and fetal outcomes through early detection and intervention.

## Conclusion
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes that screening for gestational diabetes at 24 weeks of gestation or after yields a moderate net benefit. Earlier screening is not universally recommended due to insufficient evidence regarding the balance of benefits and harms.
