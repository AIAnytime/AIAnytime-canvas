  - title: "Vision Screening in Children Aged 6 Months to 5 Years: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement"
    description: "This paper provides updated recommendations for vision screening in children aged 6 months to 5 years by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). It underlines the importance of early detection and treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors to prevent permanent vision loss. The USPSTF recommends vision screening at least once for all children aged 3 to 5 years and highlights the insufficient evidence to assess benefits and harms of screening children younger than 3 years."
