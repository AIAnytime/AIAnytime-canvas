# Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for Opioid Use Disorder

This protocol outlines the initial medication therapy options for Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) in patients diagnosed with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). The choice of medication is based on factors such as physical dependence, detoxification status, patient preference, and treatment goals.

## Summary of the Protocol

1. **Diagnosis:**
   - Is the individual physically dependent on opioids?

2. **Detoxification Status:**
   - **Has the patient undergone medically supervised withdrawal?**
     - **Yes:**
       - Use LAI naltrexone
       - Monitor for 3 to 6 months
     - **No:**
       - Use Addiction counseling and mutual help groups
       - Discuss with individual the risks and benefits of pharmacologic management of opioid use disorder
       - Encourage treatment with naltrexone (LAI)
       - Treat with transmucosal buprenorphine for 3 to 6 months

3. **Monitoring and Treatment Goals:**
   - **Has the treatment goal been reached?**
     - **Yes:** Continue to monitor and treat with medications and psychosocial intervention
     - **No:** 
       - **High levels of physical dependence? Structured daily visits? Preference for methadone treatment?**
         - **Yes to any:** Start methadone, monitor for 3 to 6 months
         - **No to all:** Change to long-acting formulation of buprenorphine, monitor for 3 to 6 months
         
       - **Has the treatment goal been reached?**
         - **Yes:** Continue to monitor and treat with medications and psychosocial intervention
         - **No:** Add more intensive psychosocial intervention/treatment in conjunction with medication management

## Special Considerations

- **Detoxification:**
  - The protocol varies based on whether the patient has undergone medically supervised withdrawal.
  
- **Patient Counseling:**
  - Counseling and discussing the risks and benefits of pharmacologic management are crucial components of the treatment plan.

- **Special Populations:**
  - Consider level of dependence, need for support, history of medication adherence, and patient preference when deciding on the treatment.

- **Medication Choice:**
  - The choice between naltrexone, buprenorphine, and methadone is influenced by the patient's specific circumstances and potential risks.
