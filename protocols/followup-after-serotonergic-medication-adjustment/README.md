### Target Population
Patients prescribed serotonergic medications, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). 
### Recommendations
A follow-up task should be created when a patient requires a SSRI/SNR medication adjustment. Check-in with the patient within two weeks to ensure that they are tolerating the medication well and to verify that they were able to obtain the prescription.
### Importance
This approach is crucial for monitoring patient adherence and medication tolerance, which can help prevent potential complications or non-compliance. By ensuring that patients are properly followed up after medication adjustments, the protocol supports improved patient outcomes and enhances the overall effectiveness of the treatment plan.
### Conclusion
Incorporating this protocol into the clinical workflow can significantly impact clinician efficiency. It automates the task creation process for follow-ups, reducing the manual workload for care coordinators and ensuring that no follow-ups are missed. This leads to better patient management, increased adherence to treatment plans, and potentially better clinical outcomes.
