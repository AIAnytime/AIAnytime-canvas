###  Target Population
Designed for patients involved in programs or studies that require monitoring and updating of their program status, primarily facing disqualification due to specific criteria. Most suitable for patients in clinical trials or medical programs where compliance to eligibility criteria is critical.
### Recommendations
Intended to automatically communicate changes in patient program status. Specifically, when a patient's program status is updated to "disqualified," the protocol triggers a webhook to send a notification to a designated URL. This ensures that relevant stakeholders are promptly informed of the disqualification status.
### Importance
Effective communication of program status changes is crucial for maintaining accurate records and ensuring timely interventions. This protocol helps streamline the process of notifying stakeholders about disqualifications, reducing the risk of manual errors and ensuring that the necessary actions are taken promptly.
### Conclusion
By automating the notification process for disqualification events, this protocol enhances efficiency and accuracy in managing patient records. It minimizes the manual workload for clinicians and ensures that critical status changes are communicated effectively, thereby supporting better patient management and program integrity.
