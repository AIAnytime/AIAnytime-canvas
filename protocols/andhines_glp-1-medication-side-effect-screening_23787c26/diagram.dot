    SubsetScreen [label="Subset Considered for Screening", shape=box, style=rounded, color=green, fontcolor=green, comment="Patients from the initial population who have been on GLP-1 medications for a minimum duration of 4 weeks, as side effects may not be immediately apparent. Patients who have not had a documented side effect screening in the past 3 months."];
    Exclusion [label="Exclusion Criteria", shape=box, style=rounded, color=green, fontcolor=green, comment="Patients with documented allergies or contraindications to GLP-1 medications. Patients who are currently hospitalized or in acute care settings, as their side effect profile may be confounded by other treatments or conditions. Patients who have discontinued GLP-1 medications for more than 2 weeks prior to the screening."];
    Diagnostic [label="Diagnostic Interventions", shape=box, style=rounded, color=green, fontcolor=green, comment="Conduct a comprehensive review of the patient's medical history and current symptoms. Administer a standardized questionnaire to assess common side effects associated with GLP-1 medications, including but not limited to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), injection site reactions, and signs of pancreatitis (abdominal pain, elevated pancreatic enzymes). Perform laboratory tests as indicated, such as serum amylase and lipase levels, to rule out pancreatitis if symptoms suggest."];
    SuccessfulScreen [label="Conditions for Successful Screens", shape=box, style=rounded, color=green, fontcolor=green, comment="Identification and documentation of any new or worsening side effects since the initiation of GLP-1 therapy. Clear communication of findings to the patient, including education on potential side effects and when to seek medical attention. Recommendation for consultation with a healthcare provider if significant side effects are identified or if the patient expresses concern about their medication. Follow-up plan established for re-evaluation or adjustment of therapy as needed based on screening results."];
