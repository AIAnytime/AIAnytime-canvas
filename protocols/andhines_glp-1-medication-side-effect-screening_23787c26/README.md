# Summary of the Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically identify and manage side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, ensuring patient safety and optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of patients currently on GLP-1 medications, such as liraglutide and semaglutide. It then narrows down to a subset of patients who have been on these medications for at least four weeks and have not had a side effect screening in the past three months. Exclusion criteria include patients with allergies to GLP-1 medications, those hospitalized, or those who have discontinued the medication for over two weeks. The protocol recommends a comprehensive review of medical history, a standardized questionnaire for common side effects, and laboratory tests if necessary. Successful screening involves documenting new or worsening side effects, communicating findings to patients, and establishing a follow-up plan.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population**: All patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and lixisenatide.
  
- **Subset for Screening**:
  - Patients on GLP-1 medications for at least 4 weeks.
  - Patients without a side effect screening in the last 3 months.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Documented allergies or contraindications to GLP-1 medications.
  - Currently hospitalized patients or those in acute care.
  - Patients who stopped GLP-1 medications for more than 2 weeks before screening.

- **Diagnostic Interventions**:
  - Comprehensive review of medical history and symptoms.
  - Standardized questionnaire for side effects like gastrointestinal symptoms and pancreatitis.
  - Laboratory tests, such as serum amylase and lipase, if symptoms suggest pancreatitis.

- **Conditions for Successful Screens**:
  - Documenting new or worsening side effects.
  - Communicating findings and educating patients on side effects.
  - Recommending healthcare provider consultation for significant side effects.
  - Establishing a follow-up plan for re-evaluation or therapy adjustment.
