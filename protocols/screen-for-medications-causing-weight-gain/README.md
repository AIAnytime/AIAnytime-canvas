### Target Population
This protocol targets patients who are currently in a weight loss treatment program and are prescribed thiazolidinediones or sulfonylureas, which are medications commonly used to manage type 2 diabetes.
### Recommendations
For patients on thiazolidinediones or sulfonylureas, the protocol recommends that clinicians review the patient's medication list. These drugs are known to cause weight gain, which could be counterproductive for patients engaged in a weight loss program. The protocol suggests considering alternative medications that do not have this side effect.
### Importance
Thiazolidinediones and sulfonylureas are effective in managing blood sugar levels but can lead to weight gain. This can undermine the efforts of patients trying to lose weight, possibly leading to frustration or non-compliance with the treatment plan. By identifying these patients and prompting a medication review, the protocol helps clinicians align the medication regimen with the patient's weight loss goals, potentially improving both weight management and overall treatment adherence.
### Conclusion
The Weight Gain Medication Review Protocol assists clinicians in identifying patients in weight loss programs who are prescribed medications that may cause weight gain. By integrating this review into the clinical workflow, the protocol promotes proactive medication management, helping to support the patientâ€™s weight loss efforts and overall health outcomes.
