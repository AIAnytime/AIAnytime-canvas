- title: "Aspirin Use to Prevent Preeclampsia and Related Morbidity and Mortality"
  description: "This paper discusses the US Preventive Services Task Force's recommendation on the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) after 12 weeks of gestation in persons at high risk for preeclampsia to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the risk factors and disparities in the prevalence and outcomes of preeclampsia."
