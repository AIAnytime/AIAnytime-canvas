## Conditions Managed
The EMR system is specifically optimized to manage common developmental and behavioral disorders in pediatric patients, including ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorders, and learning disabilities. These conditions often require different management approaches depending on the child's age, with early childhood interventions focusing on developmental milestones and school-aged children needing support with academic and social integration.

## Scope of Treatments
Common treatment interventions include behavioral therapy, medication management, and educational support. The EMR system integrates functionality to track progress in behavioral therapies, monitor medication efficacy and side effects, and coordinate with educational institutions to provide comprehensive care.

## Settings of Care
Care teams interact with patients through various settings, including in-person office visits, secure messaging, phone calls, and video consultations. The EMR supports seamless communication and scheduling, ensuring that patients and their families can access care and support through their preferred medium, enhancing continuity and convenience.

## Protocols
The most-used protocols for this population include standardized assessment tools for diagnosing ADHD and autism, guidelines for titrating medications, and evidence-based practices for behavioral interventions. The EMR incorporates these protocols into its workflow, providing decision support and ensuring adherence to best practices to optimize patient outcomes.
