## Conditions Managed
The EMR is optimized to manage conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. It is tailored to address the needs of diverse patient populations, including adolescents, adults, and older adults, with specialized modules for each age group.

## Scope of Treatments
Common treatment interventions documented within the EMR include pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing, and group therapy sessions. The system is designed to support medication management, psychotherapy session tracking, and integrated care plans.

## Settings of Care
Care teams interact with patients through multiple modalities, including in-person office visits, secure text messaging, phone calls, and video conferencing. The EMR supports seamless integration of these communication methods, ensuring continuity of care and real-time updates to patient records.

## Protocols
The EMR incorporates widely-used protocols such as the DSM-5 criteria for diagnosis, the use of standardized screening tools like the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, and evidence-based guidelines for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for substance use disorders. Customizable care pathways are available to adapt to individual patient needs and treatment responses.
