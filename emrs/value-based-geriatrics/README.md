## Conditions Managed
The EMR system is optimized to manage common geriatric conditions, including chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis. It also supports the management of cognitive impairments like dementia and Alzheimer's, as well as conditions related to aging such as osteoporosis and frailty.

## Scope of Treatments
Common treatment interventions include medication management, chronic disease management, physical therapy, and preventive care services such as vaccinations and regular health screenings. The system supports comprehensive care plans tailored to individual patient needs, ensuring adherence to value-based care principles.

## Settings of Care
Care teams interact with patients through a variety of settings, including in-person office visits, secure messaging, phone consultations, and video conferencing. The EMR facilitates seamless communication and coordination among healthcare providers, caregivers, and patients to ensure holistic and continuous care.

## Protocols
The most-used protocols include standardized care pathways for chronic disease management, fall prevention programs, cognitive assessment protocols, and medication reconciliation processes. These protocols are integrated into the EMR to ensure consistency, improve patient outcomes, and control healthcare costs in alignment with value-based care objectives.
