## Conditions Managed
Virtual urgent care primarily addresses common, non-emergency conditions across all age groups. These include respiratory infections, minor injuries, gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract infections, and skin conditions. The EMR is tailored to efficiently document symptoms and manage the care pathways for these frequent concerns.

## Scope of Treatments
The scope of treatments in virtual urgent care includes prescribing medications, recommending over-the-counter solutions, and providing home care instructions. Providers can also initiate referrals for further in-person evaluation or specialist consultation if needed. The EMR supports quick and accurate documentation of these treatment plans to ensure continuity of care.

## Settings of Care
Care teams interact with patients through a variety of virtual methods, including secure text messaging, phone calls, and video visits. The EMR is optimized for seamless integration of these communication channels, allowing providers to switch between them as necessary while maintaining a complete and coherent patient record. This flexibility ensures that patients receive timely and appropriate care regardless of their preferred mode of communication.

## Protocols
The most-used protocols in this virtual urgent care setting include standardized triage procedures, symptom checklists, and evidence-based treatment pathways for common conditions. The EMR is configured with integrated decision support tools to guide providers through these protocols, ensuring that patient care is both efficient and adheres to the latest clinical guidelines. These protocols help streamline the patient encounter, from initial assessment to follow-up care.
