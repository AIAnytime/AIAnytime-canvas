## Conditions Managed

The EMR system is optimized to manage chronic conditions commonly affecting patients above 30, including diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, arthritis, heart disease, COPD, and gastrointestinal issues such as UC, IBS, and Crohn's Disease. The system is designed to handle patients with multiple comorbidities, providing tailored care for each condition and ensuring comprehensive management of their overall health.

## Scope of Treatments

Treatment interventions include medication management, lifestyle and dietary recommendations, regular monitoring and follow-up, and coordination with specialists. For newly diagnosed patients, the EMR provides educational resources and initial care plans, while for patients with extended care, it supports ongoing management and adjustments to treatment plans based on their evolving health status.

## Settings of Care

Care teams interact with patients primarily through virtual means such as secure text, phone, and video calls, ensuring both synchronous and asynchronous communication. In-person visits are minimized but available when necessary, especially for physical examinations or procedures that cannot be conducted remotely. The system facilitates seamless communication and collaboration among care team members to provide continuous and coordinated care.

## Protocols

Most-used protocols include regular blood glucose monitoring for diabetes, bone density scans for osteoporosis, chemotherapy schedules for cancer, and pulmonary function tests for COPD. The EMR ensures adherence to evidence-based guidelines and integrates reminders for routine screenings, medication adherence, and follow-up appointments, tailored to the specific needs of each patient.
