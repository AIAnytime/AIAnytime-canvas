## Conditions Managed
The EMR system is optimized to manage conditions such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, alcohol abuse, and PTSD. For children and adolescents (ages 5-17), the focus is on managing anxiety and depression, while adults (ages 18-65) more commonly present with a wider range of conditions, including alcohol abuse and PTSD. Tailored interventions address the specific needs of each age group.

## Scope of Treatments
Common treatment interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and medication management. Additionally, our EMR supports personalized treatment plans incorporating nutritional counseling for eating disorders and integrated substance abuse programs for alcohol abuse. Each treatment plan is meticulously documented and easily accessible for the care team.

## Settings of Care
Care teams interact with patients through a variety of secure methods, including video conferencing, phone calls, and encrypted text messaging. In-person office visits are also supported when necessary, ensuring comprehensive care. The EMR system seamlessly integrates these modalities, allowing for a fluid and flexible approach to patient care, regardless of the setting.

## Protocols
The most-used protocols for this population include evidence-based guidelines for managing depression and anxiety, such as the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 assessments. For PTSD, protocols emphasize trauma-focused CBT. Eating disorder management includes protocols related to the family-based Maudsley method.
