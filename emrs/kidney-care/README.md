## Conditions Managed
The EMR system is optimized to manage CKD (chronic kidney disease) across various stages, with a particular focus on patients aged 50 and above. This patient population includes many individuals with comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, which often complicate CKD management.

## Scope of Treatments
Common treatment interventions for CKD include regular monitoring of kidney function through blood and urine tests, prescription of medications to control blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and dietary modifications to manage electrolyte balance. Advanced stages may require interventions such as dialysis or preparation for kidney transplantation.

## Settings of Care
Care teams interact with patients through multiple channels, including in-person office visits, secure text messaging, phone consultations, and video conferencing. This multi-modal approach ensures continuous and comprehensive management of CKD, catering to the needs and preferences of an older patient population.

## Protocols
The most-used protocols for managing CKD in this patient group include standardized guidelines for blood pressure and blood glucose control, regular screening for kidney function deterioration, and protocols for the management of complications such as anemia and bone mineral disorder. These protocols are designed to ensure consistent and effective care, tailored to the specific needs of older patients with CKD.
