## Conditions Managed
The EMR is optimized to manage conditions commonly associated with aging adults, particularly those aged 35 and up. This includes managing energy levels, libido, athletic performance, cognitive acuity, appearance, inflammation, and diet optimization. Conditions such as hormonal imbalances, metabolic syndrome, cognitive decline, and chronic inflammation are frequently addressed, with tailored protocols for each age group within this demographic.

## Scope of Treatments
Common treatment interventions include hormone replacement therapy, personalized nutrition plans, cognitive training exercises, anti-inflammatory regimens, and physical fitness programs. Additionally, aesthetic treatments and lifestyle modifications are integral parts of the care strategy, aiming to improve overall quality of life and longevity.

## Settings of Care
Care teams interact with patients through a combination of in-person office visits and digital communications, including secure text, phone, and video consultations. This hybrid approach ensures continuous monitoring and support, allowing patients to receive timely advice and adjustments to their treatment plans without the need for frequent office visits.

## Protocols
The most-used protocols for this population include comprehensive hormone panels to guide replacement therapy, customized nutritional assessments to optimize diet, cognitive training programs to enhance mental sharpness, and tailored physical activity plans to boost athletic performance. Additionally, anti-inflammatory protocols and aesthetic enhancement procedures are frequently utilized to address chronic inflammation and improve appearance.
