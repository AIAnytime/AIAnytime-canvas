## Conditions Managed
The EMR for a sleep medicine practice primarily manages conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and narcolepsy. It also addresses comorbidities like obesity and mental health conditions, including anxiety and depression, which are prevalent among patients with sleep disorders.

## Scope of Treatments
Common treatment interventions include Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy for OSA, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), and pharmacological treatments for RLS and narcolepsy. Weight management and lifestyle modification programs are also integral for patients with obesity and sleep disorders.

## Settings of Care
Care teams interact with patients through a combination of in-person office visits and telemedicine services, including secure text messaging, phone consultations, and video conferencing. This multi-modal approach ensures continuous and accessible care for patients with varying needs and schedules.

## Protocols
The most-used protocols include CPAP adherence monitoring, CBT-I for insomnia, and standardized assessment tools like the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the STOP-Bang questionnaire for sleep apnea. Regular follow-ups and adjustments to treatment plans are crucial, particularly for patients with comorbid conditions requiring comprehensive and coordinated care.
