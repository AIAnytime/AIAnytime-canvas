Pediatric care covers immunizations and growth monitoring, while geriatric care focuses on managing multiple chronic conditions and preventive health screenings.

The system supports documentation of both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments, ensuring comprehensive care for all patients.

## Settings of Care
Care teams interact with patients through various settings, including in-person office visits, secure messaging, phone consultations, and video conferencing. The EMR facilitates seamless communication and coordination among healthcare providers, ensuring that patients receive timely and effective care regardless of the interaction medium.

## Protocols
