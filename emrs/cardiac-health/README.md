## Conditions Managed
The EMR system is optimized for managing patients aged 45 to 75, focusing on chronic and acute cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. Commonly handled conditions include heart failure, congenital heart failure, coronary artery disease, vascular disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, COPD, and atrial fibrillation.

## Scope of Treatments
The system supports a wide range of treatment interventions, including medication management, lifestyle modification counseling, and monitoring of vitals. It also facilitates advanced treatments such as cardiac rehabilitation, interventional cardiology procedures, and respiratory therapy.

## Settings of Care
Care teams interact with patients through a blend of in-person office visits and remote communication methods. The EMR supports secure text messaging, phone consultations, and video calls, ensuring continuous and comprehensive care regardless of the patientâ€™s location.

## Protocols
The EMR is configured with evidence-based protocols tailored for the specific needs of this patient population. Common protocols include chronic disease management plans for heart failure and diabetes, anticoagulation management for atrial fibrillation, and COPD exacerbation management guidelines. These protocols ensure standardized, high-quality care across all interactions.
